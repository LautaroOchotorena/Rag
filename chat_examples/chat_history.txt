User: In which books can I find power series?
Bot: Power series are covered in *Calculus Volume 2*.

User: give me examples
Bot: The book *Calculus Volume 2* provides several examples of power series, including:

* **Geometric series:**  ∑_{n=0}^∞ xⁿ = 1/(1-x)  for |x| < 1.  This is a fundamental example used to derive many other power series.

* **Power series for 1/(1-x)²:** Derived by differentiating the geometric series term-by-term.

* **Power series for ln(1+x):** Derived by integrating the power series for 1/(1+x) term-by-term.

* **Power series for tan⁻¹x:**  Derived similarly through integration.

* **Binomial series:** The Maclaurin series for (1+x)^r, which is a generalization of the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents.

* **Taylor series for eˣ, sin x, and cos x:** These are classic examples of Taylor series, which are power series representations of functions centered around a specific point.  The book shows how to derive these series and uses them in various applications.

* **Power series solutions to differential equations:** The text demonstrates how to find power series solutions for differential equations like Airy's equation, which cannot be solved using elementary functions.

* **Using power series to evaluate nonelementary integrals:**  The book shows how to approximate integrals of functions whose antiderivatives are not elementary functions (like ∫e^(-x²)dx) by representing the integrand as a power series and integrating term-by-term.


The book also explores how to manipulate power series through addition, subtraction, multiplication, differentiation, and integration to create new power series representations for various functions.  Many examples illustrate these techniques.

User: give me an exercise of limits obtained from the book context
Bot: Here's an exercise on limits from the provided text:

**Exercise:** Evaluate  lim<sub>x→3</sub> (x² - 3x) / (2x² - 5x - 3)

This exercise is directly from Example 2.17 in the provided text.  The example demonstrates the "factor-and-cancel" technique for evaluating limits where direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 0/0.  The solution involves factoring the numerator and denominator to simplify the expression before applying limit laws.

User: give me other authors to study calculus
Bot: The provided text mentions several authors of calculus textbooks.  Besides Gilbert Strang and Edwin "Jed" Herman (the senior contributing authors of the OpenStax Calculus text),  other contributing authors listed include:

* Catherine Abbott
* Nicoleta Virginia Bila
* Sheri J. Boyd
* Joyati Debnath
* Valeree Falduto
* Joseph Lakey
* Julie Levandosky
* David McCune
* Michelle Merriweather
* Kirsten R. Messer
* Alfred K. Mulzet
* William Radulovich
* Erica M. Rutter
* David Smith
* Elaine A. Terry
* David Torain

However, this list is not exhaustive of all calculus authors.  Many other authors have written successful calculus textbooks.  To find more, I would suggest searching online for "calculus textbooks" or browsing the mathematics section of a university bookstore or library.
