## About Calculus Volume 2

Calcu/us is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features tc enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 2 covers integration, differential equations, sequences and series, and parametric equations and polar coordinates

## Coverage and Scope Our Calculus Volume 2 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide.We

have worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the project.

## Pedagogical Foundation Throughout Calculus Volume 2 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as

modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from showing that the number e is irrational, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of the relative intensity of two earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of theorems.

## Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts

In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they've learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) Answers for selected exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book.

## Early or Late Transcendentals

Calculus Volume 2 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential and logarithmic functions are presented in Chapter 2. Integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 1 for instructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms..

## Comprehensive Art Program

Our art program is designed to enhance students' understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations diagrams, and photographs.

## Introduction

Iceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to sailboats, but they are fitted with runners, or “skates, and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on water Iceboats can move very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top iceboat racers can attain speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is moving, we can use integration to determine how far it travels. We revisit this question later in the chapter (see Example 1.27)

Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide variety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use

integrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiatior and integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications.

# 1.1 Approximating Areas

# Learning Objectives

1.1.1 Use sigma (summation) notation to calculate sums and powers of integers 1.1.2 Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve 1.1.3 Use Riemann sums to approximate area

Archimedes was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapes-in other words, the amount of space enclosed by the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion, which used smaller and smaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and closer approximations to the total area. In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.

In this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function $f(x)$ ,and the x-axis on a closed interval $[a,b]$ . Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known area (namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and closer approximations to the area. Taking a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.

Let's start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when $f(x)$ is continuous and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop techniques that apply in more general cases

# Sigma (Summation) Notation

As mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by curves. This process often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these lengthy sums, we look at some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation notation). The Greek capital letter Σ sigma, is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20 without sigma notation,wehave to write

$$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17+18+19+20.$$

We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write

1+2+3+4+…+19+20,

which is better,but still cumbersome.With siqma notation,we write this sum as

![](./images/fVtcsyg8xP8uKgMbDvTViLOhK1poZpqXq.png)

which is much more compact.

Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form

Σᵢ₌₁ⁿaᵢ

where $a_i$ describes the terms to be added, and the $i$ is called the index.Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the values, beginning with the value when. $i=1$ and ending with the value when $i=n$ .For example, an expression like ∑ᵢ₌₂⁷sᵢ isitepeted s $s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{4}+s_{5}+s_{6}+s_{7}.$ Notehatheinesused nlt e takofhetemst e

added;it does not factorinto the calculation of the sum itself. Theindex is therefore called a dummy variable.We car

use any letter we like for the index.Typically,mathematicians use $i,j,k,m_r$ m $m.$ and $n$ for indices

Let's try a couple of examples of usinq siqma notation.

### EXAMPLE 1.1

## Using Sigma Notation

a.Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms $3^i$ for $i=1,2,3,4,5$

b.Write the sum in sigma notation:

1+1/4+1/9+1/16+1/25

### $②$ Solution a.Write

∑ᵢ₌₁⁵3ⁱ = 3+3²+3³+3⁴+3⁵ = 363

∑ᵢ₌₁⁵ 1/i²

![](./images/fyDx5rzKv02kIwW9ApygrFG4C2T6A5ARr.png)

Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms 2′ for i = 3, 4, 5, 6

The properties associated with the summation process are given in the following rule.

### Rule: Properties of Siqma Notation

Let a₁, a₂, …, aₙ $a_n$ an and b₁, b₂, …, bₙ bn $b_n$ represent two sequences of terms and let c be a constant. The following properties hold for all positive integers n and for integers $m.$ with 1 ≤ m ≤ n

1.

∑_{i=1}^nc=nc, ∑_{i=1}^ncaᵢ=c∑_{i=1}^naᵢ, ∑_{i=1}^n(aᵢ+bᵢ)=∑_{i=1}^naᵢ+∑_{i=1}^nbᵢ, ∑_{i=1}^n(aᵢ-bᵢ)=∑_{i=1}^naᵢ-∑_{i=1}^nbᵢ, ∑_{i=1}^naᵢ=∑_{i=1}^maᵢ+∑_{i=m+1}^naᵢ

2.

3.

4.

5.

### Proof

We prove properties 2. and 3.here,and leaveproof of the other properties to the Exercises.

2. We have

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿcaᵢ = ca₁+ca₂+ca₃+⋯+caₙ = c(a₁+a₂+a₃+⋯+aₙ) = c∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿaᵢ

3. We have

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (aᵢ + bᵢ) = (a₁ + b₁) + (a₂ + b₂) + (a₃ + b₃) + ... + (aₙ + bₙ) = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ) + (b₁ + b₂ + b₃ + ... + bₙ) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ + ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ bᵢ.

口

Afew more formulas for frequently found functions simplify the summation process further.These are shown in the next rule,for sums and powers of integers, and we use them in the next set of examples.

### Rule: Sums and Powers of Integers

1.The sum of n integers is given by

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ i = 1+2+…+n = n(n+1)/2.

2.The sum of consecutive integers squared is given by
∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿi²=1²+2²+…+n²=n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

3.The sum of consecutive integers cubed is given by
∑_(i=1)^n i³=1³+2³+…+n³=n²(n+1)²/4

# EXAMPLE 1.2

### Evaluation Using Sigma Notation Write using sigma notation and evaluate:

a.The sum of the terms $(i-3)^2$ for $i=1,2,...,200$ b.The sum of the terms $(i^{3}-i^{2})$ for $i=1,2,3,4,5,6$

## $①$ Solution a. Multiplying out $(i-3)^{2}$, we can break the expression into three terms.

∑_(i=1)^200 (i-3)² = ∑_(i=1)^200 (i²-6i+9)

∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰i² - ∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰6i + ∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰9 = 2,567,900

b.Use sigma notation property iv. and the rules for the sum of squared terms and the sum of cubed terms.
∑ᵢ₌₁⁶(i³-i²)=∑ᵢ₌₁⁶i³-∑ᵢ₌₁⁶i²

(6²(6+1)²)/4 - 6(6+1)(2(6)+1)/6 = 1764/4 - 546/6 = 350

![](./images/fIH2OFxD6WGPz4BaRaOMvLC9BEPfIMVch.png)

Find the sum of the values of $4+3i$ for i=1,2,…,100.

### EXAMPLE 1.3

### Finding the Sum of the Function Values

Find the sum of the values of $f(x)=x^{3}$ over the integers 1,2,3,…,10

Solution Using the formula, we have

∑_(i=1)^10 i³=(10)²(10+1)²/4=100(121)/4=3025

13 Evaluate the sum indicated by the notation
∩∑_{k=1}^{20}(2k+1)

## Approximating Area

Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a curve. Let $f(x)$ be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval $[a,b]$ . We want to approximate the area A bounded by $f(x)$ above, the x-axis below, the line $x=a$ on the left, and the line $x=b$ on the right (Figure 1.2)

![](./images/fOXLtFlysl6N01VIBN5WaxCpQo49f8U0w.png)

Figure 1.2 An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve f(x) at top,thex-axis at bottom,the line $x=a$ to the left, and. theline $x=b$ atright

How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region into many small shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable estimate of the true area We begin by dividing the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal width, (b-a)/n . We do this by selecting equally spacec points $x_0,x_1,x_2,...,x_n$ with $x_{0}=a,x_{n}=b$ , and

xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁ = (b-a)/n

for $i=1,2,3,...,n$

We denote the width of each subinterval with the notation Δx so x =b anc

xᵢ=x₀+iΔx

for i=1,2,3,...,n This notion of dividing an interval $[a,b]$ into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let's define some relevant terminology.

### Definition

A set of points. P={xᵢ} for i=0,1,2,…,n with a=x₀<x₁<x₂<…<xₙ=b ,which divides the interval $[a,b]$ into subintervals of the form [x₀,x₁],[x₁,x₂],… [xₙ₋₁,xₙ] is called a partition of $[a,b].$ If the subintervals all have the same width, the set of points forms a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$

We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next examine two methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation

### Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation

 On each subinterval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] (for i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n ,construct a rectangle with width△x and height equal to f(xᵢ₋₁)  which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is f(xᵢ₋₁)Δ. Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A (Figure 1.3). We use the notation $L_n$ to denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation ofA usingn subintervals.

A≈Lₙ=f(x₀)Δx+f(x₁)Δx+…+f(xₙ₋₁)Δx

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ₋₁)Δx

![](./images/fizQSb0kX327tBN2axbaWgcRBcAtNYmDb.png)

Figure 1.3 In the left-endpoint approximation of area under a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the left of each subinterva

The second method for approximating area under a curve is the right-endpoint approximation.It is almost the same as the left-endpoint approximation,but now the heights of the rectanqlesare determined by thefunction valuesat the right of each subinterval.

### Rule: Right-Endpoint Approximatior

 Construct a rectangle on each subinterval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], only this time the height of the rectangle is determined by the function value $f(x_i)$ at the right endpoint of the subinterval. Then, the area of each rectangle is f(xᵢ)Δx and the approximation for A is given by

A≈Rₙ=f(x₁)Δx+f(x₂)Δx+…+f(xₙ)Δx

 = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx

The notation $R_{n}$ indicates this is a right-endpoint approximation for A (Figure 1.4)

![](./images/fK1BgW8W1AdOdNTagAnAoa2naOgNgLHfw.png)

Fiqure 1.4 In the riqht-endpoint approximation of area under a curve, the heiqht of each rectanqle is determined by the function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoin approximation in Eigure 1.3

The graphs in Figure 1.5 represent the curve f(x)=x²/2 In graph (a) we ivide the region represented by the interva

[0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, Δx=0.5 .We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines perpendicular to $x_{i-1}$ ,the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating f(xᵢ₋₁)  for $i=1,2,3,4,5,6.$ The intervals are [0,0.5],[0.5, 1] ,[1, 1.5],[1.5,2] ,[2, 2.5],[2.5, 3] . We find the area of each rectangle by multiplying the height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area between f(x) and the x-axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint approximation.Thus,

Figure 1.5 Methods of approximating the area under a curve by using (a) the left endpoints and (b) the right endpoints.

In Eigure 1.5(b), we draw vertical lines perpendicular to $x_i$ such that $x_i$ is the right endpoint of each subinterval, and calculate $f(x_i)$ for $i=1,2,3,4,5,6$ We multiply each $f(x_i)$ by Δx to find the rectangular areas, and then add them. This is a right-endpoint approximation of the area under $f(x).$ Thus,

A ≈ R₆ = Σᵢ₌₁⁶f(xᵢ)Δx = f(x₁)Δx + f(x₂)Δx + f(x₃)Δx + f(x₄)Δx + f(x₅)Δx + f(x₆)Δx = 0.0625 + 0.25 + 0.5625 + 1 + 1.5625 + 2.25 = 5.6875.

# EXAMPLE 1.4

# Approximating the Area Under a Curve Use both left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations to approximate the area under the curve of f(x) = x²  onthe

interval [0, 2]; use $n=4$

## $②$ Solution First, divide the interval [0,2] into $n$ equal subintervals. Using n=4, Δx=(2-0)/4=0.5 .This is the width of each

rectangle. The intervals [0, 0.5] , [0.5, 1] , [1, 1.5] , [1.5, 2] are shown in Figure 1.6. Using a left-endpoint approximation, the heights are f(0)=0, f(0.5)=0.25, f(1)=1, f(1.5)=2.25 Then

Figure 1.6 The graph shows the left-endpoint approximation of the area under f(x) = x²  from 0 to 2.

The right-endpoint approximation isshown in Figure 1.7.The intervals are the same, Δx=0.5 ,but now use the right endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles. We have

Figure 1.7 The graph shows the right-endpoint approximation of the area under f(x) = x²  from 0 to 2.

The left-endpoint approximation is 1.75; the right-endpoint approximation is 3.75.

1.4 Sketch left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations for f(x) = 1/x on [1, 2] ; use η = 4. Approximate the area using both methods

Looking at Eiqure 1.5 and the graphs in Example 1.4, we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of the area under the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition, our estimate of A will improve. We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will be able to fit the rectangles to the curve more precisely,

We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let's explore the idea of increasing $n$, first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight rectangles, and finally 32 rectangles. Then, let's do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using the same sets of intervals, of the same curved region.Eigure 1.8shows the area of theregion under the curve $f(x)=(x-1)^{3}+4$ on the interval [0, 2] using a left-endpoint approximation where $n=4.$ The width of each rectangle is

Δx=(2-0)/4=1/2

The area is approximated by the summed areasof the rectangles,or

L₄ = f(0)(0.5) + f(0.5)(0.5) + f(1)(0.5) + f(1.5)0.5 = 7.5

![](./images/f8UEc9nVtf0CwqfhaVs9nWSHVXRIOd5KY.png)

Figure 1.8With a left-endpoint approximation and dividing the regionfrom a to b into four equal intervals, the area under the curve is approximately equal to the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

Figure 1.9 shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in Figure 1.8 with this graph with eight rectangles,we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve when $n=8$ .This white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The area of the rectangles is

L₈ = f(0)(0.25) + f(0.25)(0.25) + f(0.5)(0.25) + f(0.75)(0.25) + f(1)(0.25) + f(1.25)(0.25) + f(1.5)(0.25) + f(1.75)(0.25) = 7.75

![](./images/fCcC6zY0pUGg5vqizALMx9Se10w2neUNA.png)

Figure 1.9 The region under the curve is divided into $n=8$ rectangular areas of equal width for a left-endpoint approximation.

The graph in Fiqure 1.10 shows the same function with 32 rectangles inscribed under the curve. There appears to be little white space left.The area occupied by the rectangles is

L₃₂=f(0)(0.0625)+f(0.0625)(0.0625)+f(0.125)(0.0625)+...+f(1.9375)(0.0625)=7.9375

![](./images/f84dzSUknFVprS7S0S9gtGucL8w8DES1q.png)

Figure 1.10 Here, 32 rectangles are inscribed under the curve for a left-endpoint approximation.

We can carry out a similar process for the right-endpoint approximation method. A right-endpoint approximation of the same curve, using four rectangles (Figure 1.11),yields an area

R₄ = f(0.5)(0.5) + f(1)(0.5) + f(1.5)(0.5) + f(2)(0.5) = 8.5.

![](./images/fWvugM4YvEpnGIBBxXcbL81dOkzhl4YLW.png)

Figure 1.11 Now we divide the area under the curve into four equal subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation. Dividing the region over the interval [0, 2] into eight rectangles results in Δx = (2-0)/8 = 0.25 The graphis shown in Fiqure 1.12. The area is

R₈ = f(0.25)(0.25) + f(0.5)(0.25) + f(0.75)(0.25) + f(1)(0.25) + f(1.25)(0.25) + f(1.5)(0.25) + f(1.75)(0.25) + f(2)(0.25) = 8.25

![](./images/fqXdOdzyzveEYHe0df2GiOcuDMqMr194L.png)

Figure 1.12 Here we use right-endpoint approximation for a region divided into eight equal subintervals.

Last, the right-endpoint approximation with $n=32$ is close to the actual area(Figure 1.13). The area is approximately
R₃₂ = f(0.0625)(0.0625) + f(0.125)(0.0625) + f(0.1875)(0.0625) + … + f(2)(0.0625)
= 8.0625.

![](./images/f81gtz2zhvgzhGmOcI5i3GDmrzQ9CPNsr.png)

Figure 1.13 The region is divided into 32 equal subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation.

Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to approximate the area under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as n increases, both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations appear to approach an area of 8 square units. Table 1.1 shows a numerical comparison of the left- and right-endpoint methods. The idea that the approximations of the area under the curve get better and better as $n$ gets larger and larger is very important, and we now explore this idea in more detail.

## Forming Riemann Sums

So far we have been usinq rectanqles to approximate the area under a curve.The heiqhts of these rectanqles have been determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] In reality, there is no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only. We could evaluate the function at any point $x_i^*$ in the subinterval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], and use f(xᵢ*) as the height of our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the area of the form

A≈∑_{i=1}^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum.named for the 19th-centurymathematician Bernhard Riemann.who developed the idea

### Definition

Let f(x) be defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and let $P$ be a regular partition of $[a,b].$ Let △x be the width of each subinterval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] and for each $i$, let $x_{i}^{*}$ be any point in [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] A Riemann sum is defined for $f(x)$ as

∑_{i=1}^nf(xᵢ*)Δx

Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as n get larger and larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations for larger values of n. We are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums

### Definition

Let f(x) be a continuous, nonegativefuntion on an interal $[a,b]$ , and let ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ*)Δx be a Rieman sum for f(x) .Then,the area under the curve y=f(x) on $[a,b]$ is givenby

A = lim_(n→∞) Σ_(i=1)^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

### MEDIA

See a graphical demonstration (http:/www.openstax.org/l/20 riemannsums) of the construction of a Riemann sum.

Some subtleties here are worth discussing.First,note that taking the limit of a sum is a little different from taking the limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to infinity. Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter on Sequences ano Series; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used to compute limits of functions can also be used to calculate limits of sums.

### のSolution

Let's first look at the graph in Figure 1.15 to get a better idea of the area of interest.

 The intervals are [0, [0, [0,π/12] ，[否，]、[，]、[，引]，[，]，and[，].Note that f(x) = sin x is increasing on the interval [0, π/2], so a left-endpoint approximation gives usthe lower sum.A left-endpoint approximation is the Riemann

A≈sin(0)(π/12)+sin(π/12)(π/12)+sin(π/6)(π/12)+sin(π/4)(π/12)+sin(π/3)(π/12)+sin(5π/12)(π/12)

In the preceding section we defined the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums:

A = lim_(n→∞) Σ_(i=1)^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

However, this definition came with restrictions. We required $f(x)$ to be continuous and nonnegative. Unfortunately, real world problems don't always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to apply the concept of the area under the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite integral

## Definition and Notation

The definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.

### Definition

If f(x) is a function defined on an interval $[a,b]$ ,the definite integral of ffrom a to bis given by

∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = lim_{n→∞} ∑_{i=1}^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

 provided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function $f(x)$ is said to be integrable on $[a,b]$ , or is an integrable function.

The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on Applications of Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction), where we used the indefinite integral symbol (without the a and b above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation for indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related. However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we're working with a definite integral or an indefinite integral.

Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton.The integration symbol is an elongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the boundaries of the interval, [a, b]. The numbers a and b are x-values and are called the limits of integration; specifically a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of

the definite integral. First, we talk about the limit of a sum as n→∞ Second,the boundaries of theregion are called the limits of integration

We call the function $f(x)$ the integrand, and the dx indicates that $f(x)$ is a function with respect to $x$, called the variable of integration.Note that,like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no impact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = ∫ₐᵇf(t)dt = ∫ₐᵇf(u)du

Previously, we discussed the fact that if $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ ,then the limit lim ≥ f (x* )△x exists and i →00 j=

unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof

### Theorem 1.1

### Continuous Functions Are Integrablee

If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ ,then fis integrable on $[a,b]$

Functions that are not continuous on $[a,b]$ may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For example, functions continuous on a closed interval, apart from a finite number of jump discontinuities, are integrable

It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used tc define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for the Riemann sums

Riemann sum.

## $①$ Solution

We first want to set up a Riemann sum.Based on the limits of integration, we have $a=0$ and $b=2$ .For $i=0,1,2,...,n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of [0, 2] . Then

Δx = (b-a)/n = 2/n.

Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each $i_n$ we need to calculate the function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] The right endpoint of the interval is $x_i$ , and since $P$ is a regular partition,

xᵢ = x₀ + iΔx = 0 + i[2/n] = 2i/n.

Thus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is


4. f(xᵢ) = xᵢ² = (2i/n)² = 4i²/n²

Then the Riemann sum takes the form

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ)Δx = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (4i²/n²) (2/n) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ 8i²/n³ = (8/n³)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ i².

Usin tesumato foruafor Σᵢ₌₁ⁿi², wehave

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx = (8/n³)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿi²


= 8/n³[n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] = 8/n³[(2n³+3n²+n)/6] = (16n³+24n²+8n)/(6n³) = 8/3 + 4/n + 8/(6n²)

Now, to calculate the definite integral, we need to take the limit as n→∞ .We ge

∫₀²x²dx=lim_{n→∞}∑_{i=1}^nf(xᵢ)Δx

lim_(n→∞)(8/3 + 4/n + 8/(6n²)) = lim_(n→∞)(8/3) + lim_(n→∞)(4/n) + lim_(n→∞)(8/(6n²)) = 8/3 + 0 + 0 = 8/3

## Evaluating Definite Integrals

Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations. Later in this chapter we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann sums. However, for now, we can rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve, and we can evaluate definite integrals by using geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to confirm that definite integrals do, indeed represent areas, so we can then discuss what to do in the case of a curve of a function dropping below the x-axis

### EXAMPLE 1.8

### Solution

The function describes a semicircle with radius 3. To find

∫₃⁶ √(9 - (x - 3)²)dx,

we want to find the area under the curve over the interval[3,6]. The formula for the area of a circle is A=πr² .The area of a semicircle is just one-half the area of a circle, or A = (1/2)πr². The shaded area in Figure 1.16 covers one-half of the semicircle, or A = (1/4)πr². Thus,

![](./images/f3gOXHEAPb0iapkTSV4OpIKPNFk5Gu2x1.png)

Figure 1.16 The value of the integral of the function f(x) over the interval [3, 6] is the area of the shaded region

### Area and the Definite Integral

When we defined the definite integral, we lifted the requirement that f(x) be nonnegative.But how do we interpret“the area under the curve” when $f(x)$ is negative?

### NetSigned Area

Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f(x)=2-2x² (shown in Eigure 1.17) on the interval [0,2] . Use $n=8$ and choose {xᵢ*} as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each subinterval of height f(xᵢ*) and width Δx When f(xᵢ*) is positive, the product f(xᵢ*) .x represents the area of the rectangle, as before. When f(xᵢ*) is negative, however, the product f(xᵢ*)Δx represents the negative of the area of the rectangle.The Riemann sum then becomes

 f (x*）△x = (Area of rectangles above thex-axis) - (Area of rectangles below the $X$ -axis)

![](./images/fnuUyfPlaP8PL5Ao3fd9blCWakYzIlGXu.png)

Figure 1.17 For a function that is partly negative, the Riemann sum is the area of the rectangles above the x-axis less the area of the rectanqles below the x-axis

Taking the limit as n→∞ ,the Riemann sum approaches the area between the curve above the x-axis and the x-axis, less the area between the curve below the x-axis and the x-axis, as shown in Figure 1.18. Then,

∫_0²f(x)dx=lim_{n→∞}∑_{i=1}^n f(cᵢ)Δx = A₁-A₂

The quantity $A_1-A_2$ is called the net signed area

![](./images/fb3KVLGTfGlFZ6akgq56mGo2dmxgvWLcA.png)

Figure 1.18 In the limit, the definite integral equals area A less area $A_{2r}$ or the net signed area

Notice that net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero.If the area above the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is positive.If the areabelow the x-axis is larger,the net signed area is negative.If the areas above and below the x-axis are equal,the net siqned area iszero

### EXAMPLE1.9

### Finding the Net Signed Area

Find the net signed area between the curve of the function $f(x)=2x$ and the x-axis over the interval [3,3].

## $②$ Solution

The function produces a straight line that forms two triangles: one from $x=-3$ to $x=0$ and the other from $x=0$ to $x=3$ (Eigure 1.19). Using the geometric formula for the area of a triangle, A=1/2bh ,the area of triangle $A_1$ ,above the axis, is

A₁=1/2(3)(6)=9,

where 3 is the base and 2(3)=6 is the height. The area of triangle $A_2.$ below the axis,is

A₂=1/2(3)(6)=9,

where 3 is the base and 6 is the height. Thus, the net area is

∫_{-3}^3 2x dx = A₁ - A₂ = 9 - 9 = 0

![](./images/fz50mZNIlCsEzmO92S1SxwozP67fHAcvV.png)

Figure 1.19 The area above the curve and below the x-axis equals the area below the curve and above the x-axis

![](./images/fvx6e21tLUWrCeZ3HAPrwdl1a8nG63U3l.png)

If $A_1$ is the area above the x-axis and $A_2$ is the area below the x-axis, then the net area is $A_{1}-A_{2}.$ Since the areas of the two triangles are equal, the net area is zero.

![](./images/fVtKRzML8Cy0Bw0iPnqzcOiyCGkoLOVon.png)

### Total Area

One application of the definite integral is finding displacement when given a velocity function. If υ(t) represents the velocity of an object as a function of time, then the area under the curve tells us how far the object is from its original position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we examine it in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we're just going to look at some basics to get a feel for how this works by studying constant velocities.

When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very familiar. If a car travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 70 mph for 2 hours, then it is 140 mi away from its oriqinal position (Eigure 1.20). Using inteqral notation, we have

∫₀²⁷0dt = 140

![](./images/fxtsMlr8Q5xmZAKEgviFVG9KpYlsHpE6d.png)
Figure 1.20 The area under the curve υ(t)=70 tells us how far the car is from its starting point at a given time.

In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels straight north at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is $120mi$ north of its starting position. If the car then turns around and travels south at a speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position (Figure 1.21). Again, using integral notation, we have

∫₀² 60dt + ∫₂⁵ -40dt = 120 - 120 = 0

In this case the displacement is zero.

![](./images/fXkkZ3mfkOoMDR6XYvdv6pCGi068mVpfY.png)
Figure 1.21 The area above the axis and the area below the axis are equal, so the net signed area is zero.

Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to know the area between the curve and the x-axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis. This is called the total area.

Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas below the axis (rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To accomplish this mathematically, we use the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the car is

∫₀²|60|dt+∫₂⁵|-40|dt =∫₀²60dt+∫₂⁵40dt =120+120 =240.

Bringing these ideas together formally, we state the following definitions

### Definition

Let f(x) be an integrable function defined on an interval $[a,b].$ Let $A_1$ represent the area between f(x) andthe x-axis that lies above the axis and let $A_2$ represent the area between f(x) and the x-axis that lies below the axis. Then, thenet signed area between $f(x)$ and the x-axis is given by

∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)dx = A₁ - A₂

The total area between f(x) and the x-axis is given by

∫ₐᵇ|f(x)| dx = A₁ + A₂

# EXAMPLE 1.10

### Finding the Total Area

Find the total area between $f(x)=x-2$ and the x-axis over the interval [0, 6] .

![](./images/fcVDbNmZndvZF7HwFCcVLzbQbGNDEQvfU.png)

Calculate the x-intercept as (2,0) (set $y=0$ , solve for x). To find the total area, take the area below the x-axis over the subinterval[0, 2] and add it to the area above the x-axis on the subinterval [2, 6](Figure 1.22)

![](./images/fBgqg0fRfNvagQ96cnCavV7RbUoQIbqWW.png)

Figure 1.22 The total area between the line and the x-axis over [0,6] is Az plus A1

We have

∫₀⁶|x-2|dx = A₂ + A₁

Then,using the formula for the area of a triangle,we obtain

A₂ = (1/2)bh = (1/2)(2)(2) = 2, A₁ = (1/2)bh = (1/2)(4)(4) = 8.

The total area, then, is

$$A_1+A_2=8+2=10.$$

### Properties of the Definite Inteqral

The properties of indefinite integrals apply to definite integrals as well. Definite integrals also have properties that relate to the limits of integration. These properties, along with the rules of integration that we examine later in this chapter help us manipulate expressions to evaluate definite integrals.

### Rule:Properties of the Definite Integra

1.

∫ₐᵃf(x)dx = 0

If the limits of integration are the same, the integral is just a line and contains no area.

2.

∫ᵇᵃf(x)dx=-∫ᵃᵇf(x)dx

If the limits are reversed,then place a negative sign in front of the integral.

3.

∫ₐᵇ[f(x)+g(x)]dx=∫ₐᵇf(x)dx+∫ₐᵇg(x)dx

The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals

4.

∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx=∫ₐᵇf(x)dx-∫ₐᵇg(x)dx

The integral of a difference is the difference of the integrals

5.

∫_a^b cf(x)dx = c∫_a^b f(x)dx

for constant c. The integral of the product of a constant and a function is equal to the constant multiplied by the integral of the function

6.

∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = ∫ₐᶜ f(x)dx + ∫ᶜᵇ f(x)dx

Although this formula normally applies when c is between a and $b.$ the formula holds for all values of a, b, and c provided $f(x)$ is integrable on the largest interval.

### EXAMPLE 1.11

### Using the Properties of the Definite Integral Use the properties of the definite integral to express the definite integral of $f(x)=-3x^{3}+2x+2$ over the interval

[-2,1] as the sum of three definite integrals

Use the properties of the definite integral to express the definite integral of f(x)=6x³-4x²+2x-3 √2  1.11 over the interval [1,3] as the sum of four definite integrals.

# EXAMPLE 1.12

## Using the Properties of the Definite Integral

Ifits nowthat ∫₀⁸f(x)dx = 10 and ∫₀⁵ f(x)dx = 5 fin the valueof ∫₅⁸f(x) $dx$

### Solution

By property 6.,

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=∫ₐᶜf(x)dx+∫ᶜᵇf(x)dx

Thus,

∫₀⁸f(x)dx = ∫₀⁵f(x)dx + ∫₅⁸f(x)dx; 10 = 5 + ∫₅⁸f(x)dx; 5 = ∫₅⁸f(x)dx

✓ 112 If it is known that ∫₁⁵f(x)dx=-3 and ∫₂⁵f(x)dx=4, find the value of ∫₁²f(x)dx.

### Comparison Properties of Integrals

A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function $f(x)$ is above another function $g(x)$ ,then the area between f(x) and the x-axis is greater than the area between g(x) and the x-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether $a<b,a=b$ or $a>b$ . The following properties, however, concern only the case a≤b , and are used when we want to compare the sizes of integrals.

### Theorem 1.2

### Comparison Theorem

i.If f(x) ≥ 0 for a ≤ x ≤ b ,then

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≥0

ilIf f(x)≥g(x) for a ≤ x ≤ b .then

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≥∫ₐᵇg(x)dx.

ii.If m and M are constants such that m ≤ f(x) ≤ M for a ≤ x ≤ b, then

m(b-a)≤∫ₐᵇf(x)dx ≤ M(b-a).

# EXAMPLE 1.13

### Comparing Two Functions over a Given Interval Compare f(x) = √(1 + x²) and g(x) = √(1 + x) over the interval [0, 1].

![](./images/fw1wGXEkELZ8KPSrGY3KdgWxIdY16yUCC.png)

Graphinq these functions is necessary to understand how they compare over the interval [0, 1]. Initially, when qraphed on a graphing calculator, f(x) appears to be above g(x) everywhere. However, on the interval [0, 1], the graphs appear to be on top of each other. We need to zoom in to see that, on the interval [0,1], g(x) (x) $(x)$ is above $f(x)$ The two functions intersect at $x=0$ and $x=1$ (Fiqure 1.23)

![](./images/f2IR50Z1TSpcOvSDGcFMTP4phFMRkXBvi.png)

Figure 1.23 (a) The function f(x) appears above the function g(x) except over the interval [0, 1] (b) Viewing the same graph with a greater zoom shows this more clearly

We can see from the graph that over the interval [0, 1], g(x) ≥ f(x) Comparing the integrals over the specified interval [0 l e als ethat ∫₀¹ g(x) dx ≥ ∫₀¹ f(x) dx (Eigure124. he tin,redshaded arashowsut how uch difference there is between these two integrals over the interval [0, 1]

## Average Value of a Function

We oftenneed tofind the average ofa setofnumbers.such asan averaae test arade.Supposeyou received the following test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your average of test scores and you want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.In this case, there are six test scores.Thus

 (89+90+56+78+100+69)/6=482/6≈80.33.

Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a B- at most schools.

Suppose, however, that we have a function υ(t) that gives us the speed of an object at any time $t_r$ and we want to find the object's average speed. The function v(t) takes on an infinite number of values, so we can't use the process just described. Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a function such as this.

Let $f(x)$ be continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ and let $[a,b]$ be divided into $m$ subintervals of width Δx=(b-a)/n Choose a representative $x_i^*$ in each subinterval and calculate f(xᵢ*) for i=1,2,…,n In other words, consider each f(xᵢ*) as a sampling of the function over each subinterval. The average value of the function may then be approximated as

(f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+⋯+f(xₙ*))/n,

which is basically the same expression used to calculate the averaae of discrete values

But we know Δx = (b - a)/n ,So n = (b-a)/Δx , and we get

(f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+…+f(xₙ*))/n=(f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+…+f(xₙ*))/((b-a)/Δx)

Followin h eih wt te alebe, te emeratoi ten hat re eer e a ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ*) and we ar didin ty fraction. To divide by a fraction, invert the denominator and multiply. Thus, an approximate value for the average value of the function is givenby

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) (b-a)/Δx = (Δx/(b-a))∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) = (1/(b-a))∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*)Δx.

This is a Riemann sum.Then, to qet the exact averaqe value, take the limit as $n$ qoes to infinity. Thus, the average value of a function is given by


(1/(b-a))lim(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx = (1/(b-a))∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

### Definition

Let f(x) be continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ .Then, the average value of the function f(x) (or f<sub>ave</sub> on $[a,b]$ is given by

f<sub>avc</sub> = 1/(b-a)∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)dx.

# EXAMPLE 1.14

 Finding the Average Value of a Linear Function Find the average value of f(x) = x + 1 over the interval [0, 5]

First, graph the function on the stated interval, as shown in Figure 1.25.

### Solution

![](./images/fWlGGt5xTAI8Np4ZUcfFcgqczgTyQ61AW.png)

Figure 1.25 The graph shows the area under the function f(x) = x + 1 over [0, 5]

The region is a trapezoid lying on its side,so we can use the area formula for a trapezoid A =h (a + b),where $h$ represents height, and a and b represent the two parallel sides. Then,

∫_0^5 (x+1)dx = (1/2)h(a+b) = (1/2)*5*(1+6) = 35/2

Thus the average value of the function is

1/5∫₀⁵(x+1)dx = 1/5 * 35/2 = 7/2.

## 1.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Learning Objectives

1.3.1 Describe the meaning of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals 1.3.2 State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1. 1.3.3 Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, to evaluate derivatives of integrals. 1.3.4 State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 21.3.5 Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 2, to evaluate definite integrals. 1.3.6 Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration

In the previous two sections, we looked at the definite integral and its relationship to the area under the curve of a function. Unfortunately, so far, the only tools we have available to calculate the value of a definite integral are geometric area formulas and limits of Riemann sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at some more powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.

These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This relationship was discovered and explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early

1700s, and it is codified in what we now call the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,which has two parts that we examine in this section.Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of calculus.

## MEDIA

Isaac Newton's contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the world. The relationships he discovered, codified as Newton's laws and the law of universal gravitation, are still taught as foundational material in physics today, and his calculus has spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, read a brief biography (http://www.openstax.org/l/20 newtonbio) of Newton with multimedia clips.

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let's examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

# The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuousfunction on a closed interval takes on its average value at some point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if $f(x)$ is continuous, a point c exists in an interval $[a,b]$ such that the value of the function at $c$ is equal to the average valueof $f(x)$ over $[a,b]$ .We state this theorem mathematically with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.

### Theorem 1.3

### The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

If f(x) is continuous over an interval $[a,b]$ , then there is at least one point c ∈ [a, b] such that

f(c)=1/(b-a)∫ₐᵇf(x)dx.

This formula can also be stated as

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=f(c)(b-a)

## Proof

Since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , by the extreme value theorem (see Maxima and Minima (http://openstax.org/books/. calculus-volume-1/pages/4-3-maxima-and-minima)), it assumes minimum and maximum values-m and M respectively-on $[a,b].$ Then, for all $x$ in $[ a, b]$ , we have m ≤ f(x) ≤ M Therefore,by the comparison theorem (see Ihe Definite Integral), we have

m(b-a)≤∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≤M(b-a)

Dividing by $b-a$ gives us

m ≤ (1/(b-a))∫ₐᵇf(x)dx ≤ M

Since 。f(x)dx is a number between $m$ and M, and since $f(x)$ is continuous and assumes the values m and M over $[a,b]$ , by the Intermediate Value Theorem (see Continuity (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/ 2-4-continuity), there is a number $c$ over $[a,b]$ such that

f(c)=1/(b-a)∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

and the proof is complete

## EXAMPLE 1.15

### Finding the Average Value of a Function

Find the average value of the function $f(x)=8-2x$ over the interval [0, 4] and find c such that f(c) equals the average value of the function over [0, 4]

### $②$ Solution

The formula states the mean value of $f(x)$ is given by

1/4 ∫₀⁴ (8-2x) dx

We can see in Figure 1.26 that the function represents a straight line and forms aright triangle bounded by the $x-$ and y-axes. The area of the triangle is A=1/2 (base) (height) . We have

A = 1/2(4)(8) = 16

The average value is found by multiplying the area by 1/(4-0) . Thus, the average value of the function is

¼(16)=4

Set the average value equal to f(c) and solve for c

8-2c=4; c=2

At $c=2,f(2)=4$

![](./images/fqZB1vchBTZvINSi2LPcczAVbkAfQK8GW.png)

Figure 1.26 By the Mean Value Theorem, the continuous function f(x) takes on its average value at c at least once over a closed interval.

# EXAMPLE 1.16

### Finding the Point Where a Function Takes on Its Average Value

Given x²dx = 9, find c such that f(c) equals the average alue of $f(x)=x^{2}$ over [0,3]

![](./images/fCfkCYmKGhaVM1czL44wZ5UbFoMaPd5F1.png)

We are looking for the value of c such that

f(c) = 1/(3-0)∫₀³x²dx = (1/3)(9) = 3.

 Replacing f(c) with $c^{2}.$ we have

c² = 3; c = ±√3

Since -√3 is outside the interval, take only the positive value.Thus, c=√3 (Eigure 1.27)

![](./images/fcyNVmkvYA9GQ76syN28GGFFkhvOf9rMs.png)

Figure 1.27 Over the interval [0, 3], the function f(x) = x²  takes on its average value at c=√3

115 Given (2x² - 1) dx = 15, find c such that f(c) equals the average value of $f(x)=2x^2-1$ over [0. 3]

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Inteqrals and Antiderivatives

As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration

### Theorem 1.4

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.Part 

If f(x) is continuous over an interval $[ a, b]$ , and the function $F(x)$ is defined by

F(x) = ∫ₐˣ f(t)dt

then F'(x) = f(x) over $[a,b]$

Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note that we have defined a function, $F(x)$ , as the definite integral of another function, $f(t)$ ,from the point a to the point $x.$

At first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like it's a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of $x_r$ the definite integral is a number. So the function $F(x)$ returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of $x.$

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem.There is a reason it is called the Fundamenta/Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between inteqration and differentiation, but also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative.

### Proof

Applying the definition of the derivative, we have

F'(x) = lim_(h→0) (F(x+h)-F(x))/h = lim_(h→0) (1/h)[∫ₐˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt - ∫ₐˣ f(t)dt] = lim_(h→0) (1/h)[∫ₐˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt + ∫ₓᵃ f(t)dt] = lim_(h→0) (1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt.

Lokin aly t ti ast ersion, ee (1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt i us he averag ale o he ntion f(x) overthe interal $[x,x+h]$ . Therefore, by The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, there is some number cin $[x,x+h]$ such that

(1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰf(x)dx=f(c)

In addition, since $c$ is between $x$ and $x+h$, $C$ approaches $x$ as $h$ approaches zero. Also, since $f(x)$ is continuous, we have lim_{h→0} f(c) = lim_{c→x} f(c) = f(x) Putting al these pieces together, we have

F′(x)=lim_(h→0)(1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰf(x)dx=lim_(h→0)f(c)=f(x)

and the proof is complete

Differentiating the second term, we first let $u(x)=2x$ .Then,

d/dx[∫₀²ˣt³dt]=(2x)³⋅2=16x³

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus.After tireless efforts by mathematicians for approximately 5o0 years, new techniques emerged that provided scientists with the necessary tools to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary orbits. Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could now be handled with simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the three dimensional motion of objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus.

After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of n rectangles, the application of this theorem is straightforward by comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.

### Theorem 1.5

### The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.Part 2

If fis continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ and $F(x)$ is any antiderivative of $f( x)$ , ther

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a).

We often see the notation $F(x)|_a^b$ to denote the expression $F( b) - F( a)$ . We use this vertical bar and associated limits a and b to indicate that we should evaluate the function $F(x)$ at the upper limit (in this case,b),and subtract the value of the function $F(x)$ evaluated at the lower limit (in this case, a)

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem) states that if we can find an antiderivative for the integrand, then we can evaluate the definite integral by evaluating the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval and subtracting.

## Proof

Let P = {xᵢ}, i=0,1,...,n be a regular partition of $[ a, b]$ . Then, we can write

F(b) - F(a) = F(xₙ) - F(x₀) = [F(xₙ) - F(xₙ₋₁)] + [F(xₙ₋₁) - F(xₙ₋₂)] + ... + [F(x₁) - F(x₀)] = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ[F(xᵢ) - F(xᵢ₋₁)]

Now, we know $F$ is an antiderivative of fover $[a,b]$ , so by the Mean Value Theorem (see The Mean Value Theorem (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-4-the-mean-value-theorem)) for $i=0$ , 1.,.., n we can find $c_i$ ir [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] such that

F(xᵢ)-F(xᵢ₋₁)=F'(cᵢ)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)=f(cᵢ)Δx.

Then, substituting into the previous equation, we have

F(b) - F(a) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(cᵢ)Δx.

Taking the limit of both sides as n→∞ , we obtain

F(b)-F(a) = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(cᵢ)Δx = ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

### EXAMPLE 1.20

Evaluating an Integral with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Use Ihe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 to evaluate

∫₋₂² (t²-4)dt

## $①$ Solution

Recall the power rule for Antiderivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-10-antiderivatives)

If y=xⁿ, ∫xⁿdx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)+C

Use this rule to find the antiderivative of the function and then apply the theorem. We have

∫_{-2}^2 (t² - 4)dt = t³/3 - 4t|_{-2}^2

[(2³/3) - 4(2)] - [(-2³/3) - 4(-2)] = (8/3 - 8) - (-8/3 + 8) = 16/3 - 16 = -32/3

![](./images/fG0gMzEH2uMfOCGoKl3PoorSV4Sg4QrgP.png)

Notice that we did not include the +C' term when we wrote the antiderivative. The reason is that, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience,we chose the antiderivative with $C=0$ . If we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out. This always happens when evaluating a definite integral.

The reqion of the area we just calculated is depicted in Fiqure 1.28. Note that the reqion between the curve and the x-axis is all below the x-axis. Area is always positive, but a definite integral can still produce a negative number (a net signed area). For example, if this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company is operating at a loss over the given interval.

![](./images/f99eV6pelhREfIxMiwVlsTQK1uHN1gwfF.png)

Figure 1.28 The evaluation of a definite integral can produce a negative value, even though area is always positive

## EXAMPLE 1.21

Evaluating a Definite Inteqral Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 Evaluate the following integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 2

∫₁⁹(x-1)/√x dx

## $②$ Solution

First, eliminate the radical by rewriting the integral usinq rational exponents. Then, separate the numerator terms b writing each one over the denominator

∫₁⁹(x-1)/x¹/²dx=∫₁⁹(x/x¹/²-1/x¹/²)dx.

Use the properties of exponents to simplify

∫₁⁹ (x/x^(1/2)-1/x^(1/2))dx=∫₁⁹ (x^(1/2)-x^(-1/2))dx

Now, integrate using the power rule:

∫₁⁹(x¹⁄²-x⁻¹⁄²)dx = (2x³/³/2 - 2x¹⁄²)│₁⁹ = [2/3(27) - 2(3)] - [2/3(1) - 2(1)] = 18 - 6 - 2/3 + 2 = 40/3.

### EXAMPLE 1.22

### A Roller-Skating Race

James and Kathy are racing on roller skates. They race along a long, straight track, and whoever has gone the farthest after 5 sec wins a prize.If James can skate at a velocity of $f(t)=5+2t$ ft/sec andKathy can skate at a velocity of g(t) = 10 + cos(πt/2) ft/sec, who is going to win the race?

![](./images/fbK2fm6BC2dNg6kA1REoYgvXvpfWf8kO9.png)

We need to integrate both functions over the interval [0,5] and see which value is bigger. For James, we want to calculate

∫₀⁵(5+2t)dt

Using the power rule, we have

∫₀⁵(5+2t)dt = (5t + t²)│₀⁵ = 50

Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate


∫₀⁵(10+cos(πt/2))dt

We know sint is an antiderivative of cost, so it is reasonable to expect that an antiderivative of cos (π/2)t would involve sin(πt/2) However, when we differentiate sin(π/2t), we get π/2cos(π/2t) as a result of the chain rule, so we have to account for this additional coefficient when we inteqrate. We obtair

∫₀⁵ 10+cos(π/2t)dt = (10t + (2/π)sin(π/2t))|₀⁵ = (50 + 2/π) - 0 ≈ 50.6

Kathy has skated approximately 50.6 ft after 5 sec.Kathy wins,but not by much!

STUDENT PROJECT

A Parachutist in Free Fall

![](./images/fVIluNy9QV9kO8RZLTyehWGn5S1yykDpv.png)
Figure 1.30 Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body during the free fall

(credit: Jeremy T. Lock)

Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).

Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify our calculations.Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by υ(t)=32t She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.

On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower “belly down" position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec) Using this information, answer the following questions.

1.How long after she exits the aircraft doesJulie reach terminal velocity？ 2.Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more integrals that represents the distance Julie falls after 30 sec 3.If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 30o0 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall? 4.Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and for her to slow down, during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec. Find the total time Julie spends in the air, from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the ground. On Julie's second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients herself in the *head down” position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec. Answer these questions based on this velocity 5.How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case? 6.Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the “belly down position so she is not moving quite as fast

when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 40oo ft, how long does she spend in a free fall before beginning the reorientation?

Some jumpers wear "wingsuits" (see Figure 1.31). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called *flying squirrel suits.") When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec), allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph, much too fast to land safely.

202. Kepler's first law states that the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The closest point of a planetary orbit to the Sun is called the perihelion (for Earth, it currently occurs around January 3) and the farthest point is called the aphelion (for Earth, it currently occurs around July 4). Kepler's second law states that planets sweep out equal areas of their elliptical orbits in equal times. Thus, the two arcs indicated in the following figure are swept out in equal times.

# 1.4 Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem.

### Learning Objectives

1.4.1Apply the basic integration formulas 1.4.2 Explain the significance of the net change theorem. 1.4.3Use the net change theorem to solve applied problems. 1.4.4Apply the integrals of odd and even functions.

In this section, we use some basic integration formulas studied previously to solve some key applied problems. It is important to note that these formulas are presented in terms of indefinite integrals. Although definite and indefinite integrals are closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either a number (when the limits of integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables) An indefinite integral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with integration, you will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct approach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind, think carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper notationbased on your choice.

## Basic Integration Formulas

 Recall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/ 4-10-antiderivatives) and the rule on properties of definite integrals. Let's look at a few examples of how to apply these rules.

### EXAMPLE 1.23

### Integrating a Function Using the Power Rule Use the poweulet iteate e unat ∫₁⁴√t(1+t)dt

### $②$ Solution

The first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule
∫₁⁴√t(1+t)dt = ∫₁⁴t¹/²(1+t)dt = ∫₁⁴(t¹/²+t³/²)dt

Now apply the power rule:

∫₁⁴(t¹⁄²+t³⁄²)dt=(2/3t³⁄²+2/5t⁵⁄²)│₁⁴=[2/3(4)³⁄²+2/5(4)⁵⁄²]-[2/3(1)³⁄²+2/5(1)⁵⁄²]=256/15.

1.21 Find the definite integral of f(x) = x² - 3x over the interval [1, 3] .

## The Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change.It says that when a quantity changes, the new value equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways. The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

### Theorem 1.6

### Net Change Theorem

The new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change

F(b)=F(a)+∫ₐᵇF'(x)dx or ∫ₐᵇF'(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)

Subtracting $F(a)$ from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation.Since they are equivalent formulas which one we use depends on the application

The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results.Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume, to name only a few applications.Net change accounts for neaative guantities automatically without having to write more than one integral. To illustrate, let's apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is displacement.

We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction) at 40 mph between 2 p.m. and $4p.m.$ , then the car moves south at 30 mph between $4p.m$ . and 5 p.m. We can graph this motion as shown in Figure 1.32

![](./images/fTKGIvt0xPxN7bIxkSDQ4WSWe2LMw9qdE.png)

Figure 1.32 The graph shows speed versus time for the given motion of a car.

Just aswe did before,we can use definite inteqrals to calculate the net displacement as wellas the total distance traveled. The net displacement is given by

∫₂⁵v(t)dt = ∫₂⁴40dt + ∫₄⁵-30dt = 80 - 30 = 50

Thus. at 5 p.m.the car is 50 mi north of its starting position.The total distance traveled is aiven by

∫₂ˢ|v(t)| dt = ∫₂⁴40dt + ∫₄⁵30dt = 80 + 30 = 110.

Therefore, between 2 p.m. and $5p.m$ , the car traveled a total of $110mi$

To summarize,net displacement may include both positive and neqative values. In other words, the velocity function accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive.To find the total distance traveled by an object regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function.

## EXAMPLE 1.24

### Finding Net Displacement

Given a velocity function v(t)=3t-5 (in meters per second) for a particle in motion from time $l=0$ to time $t=3$ ,find the net displacement of the particle.

Applying the net change theorem, we have

∫₀³(3t - 5)dt = (3t²/2 - 5t)|₀³ = [(3(3)²/2) - 5(3)] - 0 = 27/2 - 15 = 27/2 - 30/2 = -3/2

The net displacement is -3/2 m (Figqure 1.33)

![](./images/fFF9uzQ4tXOFhiEgXAFRO8G3QpRG6itmf.png)

Figure 1.33 The graph shows velocity versus time for a particle moving with a linear velocity function.

## EXAMPLE 1.25

### Finding the Total Distance Traveled UseExample 1.24 to find the total distance traveled by a particle according to the velocity function $v(t)=3t-5$ m/sec

over a time interval [0,3]

## $②$ Solution

The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.

To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance.First, find the t-intercept of the function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs.Set the eauation eaual to zero and solve for t Thus

3t-5=0; 3t=5; t=5/3

The two subintervals are [0, 5/3] and [5/3,3]. To find the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of the function. Since the function is negative over the interval [0, 5/3] ,we have |v(t)| = -v(t) over that interval. Over [5/3, 3] the function is positive, so $|v(t)|=v(t)$ Thus, we have

∫₀³|v(t)|dt = ∫₀⁵⁄³-v(t)dt + ∫₅⁄³³v(t)dt = ∫₀⁵⁄³(5-3t)dt + ∫₅⁄³³(3t-5)dt = (5t - (3t²)/2)|₀⁵⁄³ + ((3t²)/2 - 5t)|₅⁄³³ = [5(5/3) - 3(5/3)²/2] - 0 + [27/2 - 15] - [3(5/3)²/2 - 25/3] = 25/3 - 25/6 + 27/2 - 15 - 25/6 + 25/3 = 41/6

So, the total distance traveled is (41/6)m

1.22 Find the net displacement and total distance traveled in meters given the velocity function f(t)=eⁱ/2-2 over the interval [0, 2].

# Applying the Net Change Theorem.

The net change theorem can be applied to the flow and consumption of fluids, as shown in Example 1.26

### EXAMPLE 1.26

### How Many Gallons of Gasoline Are Consumed?

If the motor on a motorboat is started at $t=0$ and the boat consumes gasoline at the rate of $5-0.1t^3$ gal/hr how much gasoline is used in the first 2 hours?

## $②$ Solution

Express the problem as a definite integral, integrate, and evaluate using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The limits of integration are the endpoints of the interval [0, 2]. We have

∫₀² (5 - 0.1t³) dt = (5t - 0.1t⁴/4)|₀² = [5(2) - 0.1(2)⁴/4] - 0 = 10 - 0.4 = 9.6

Thus,the motorboat uses9.6gal of gas in2hours.

# EXAMPLE 1.27

### Chapter Opener: Iceboats

![](./images/fn2zuY6GrM4m1Rgukpf4WNRYHA09ffVco.png)
Figure 1.34 (credit: modification of work by Carter Brown, Flickr).

As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers (Figure 1.1) can attain speeds of up to five times the wind speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the wind speed. Suppose Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been blowing all morning. As Andrew gets his iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first half hour of iceboating, the wind speed increases according to the function v(t) = 20ι + 5 .For the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind remains steady at 15

mph. In other words, the wind speed is given by

v(t) = {20t + 5 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2, 15 for 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1}

Recalling that Andrew's iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line away from his starting point,how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?

## のSolution To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed. Then

e = ∫₀¹2v(t)dt
Distance

Substituting the expressions we were given for v(t), we get

∫₀¹2v(t)dt = ∫₀¹⁄²2v(t)dt + ∫₁⁄²¹2v(t)dt = ∫₀¹⁄²2(20t+5)dt + ∫₁⁄²¹2(15)dt = ∫₀¹⁄²(40t+10)dt + ∫₁⁄²¹30dt = [20t²+10t]|₀¹⁄² + [30t]|₁⁄²¹ = (20/4+5)-0+(30-15) = 25

Andrew is 25 mi from his startinq point after 1 hour

1.23 Suppose that, instead of remaining steady during the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind starts to die down according to the function v(t)=-10t+15 . In other words, the wind speed is given by

v(t)={20t+5 for 0≤t≤1/2, -10t+15 for 1/2≤t≤1}

Under these conditions, how far from his starting point is Andrew after 1 hour?

# Integrating Even and Odd Functions

We saw in Functions and Graphs (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/1-introduction) that an even function is a function in which $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all x in the domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when $X$ isreplaced with $-x.$ The graphs of even functions are symmetric about they-axis.Anodd function is one in which f(-x) = -f(x) for all $x$ in the domain, and the graph of the function is symmetric about the origin.

Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from -a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly $[-a,a]$ ,evaluate to zero because the areasabove andbelow thex-axis are equal

### Rule: Inteqrals of Even and Odd Functions

For continuous even functionssuch that f(-x)=f(x)

∫₋ₐᵃf(x)dx=2∫₀ᵃf(x)dx

For continuous odd functions such that f(-x) = -f(x)

∫₋ₐᵃf(x)dx=0

### EXAMPLE 1.28

### Integrating an Even Function

Integrate the ven unction ∫_{-2}^2 (3x⁸ - 2)dx and veriy tha theinterton te mul o even untions hodndnd

### $②$ Solution The symmetry appears in the graphs in Figure 1.35. Graph (a) shows the region below the curve and above the x-axis. We

have to zoom in to this graph by a huge amount to see the region. Graph (b) shows the region above the curve and below the x-axis. The signed area of this region is negative. Both views illustrate the symmetry about the y-axis of an even function.We have

∫₋₂² (3x⁸ - 2)dx = [(x⁹/3 - 2x)]|₋₂² = [(2⁹/3 - 4) - ((-2)⁹/3 + 4)] = (512/3 - 4) - (-512/3 + 4) = 1000/3

To verify the integration formula for even functions, we can calculate the integral from 0 to 2 and double it, then check to make sure we get the same answer.


∫_{0}^{2}(3x⁸-2)dx=(x⁹/3-2x)|_{0}^{2}=512/3-4=500/3

Since 2⋅500/3=1000/3. we have verified the formula for even functions in this particular example

![](./images/fTEQy9Z8u0kgdDb4XXc5gNfIFRBpXg8mm.png)

Figure 1.35 Graph (a) shows the positive area between the curve and the x-axis, whereas graph (b) shows the negative area between the curve and the x-axis.Both views show the symmetry about the y-axis

### EXAMPLE 1.29

### Integrating an Odd Function

Evaluate the definite integral of theodd function -5sin x over the interval [-π,π]

### $②$ Solution

The graph is shown in Figure 1.36. We can see the symmetry about the origin by the positive area above the $x-$ axis over [-π,0] ,and the negative area below the $x-$ axis over [0,π] We have

∫₋ππ -5sin x dx = -5(-cos x)|₋ππ

5cos x|₋π^π = [5cosπ] - [5cos(-π)] = -5 - (-5) = 0

Figure 1.36 The graph shows areas between a curve and the x-axis for an odd function

1.5 Substitution

Learning Objectives

1.5.1 Use substitution to evaluate indefinite integrals 1.5.2 Use substitution to evaluate definite integrals

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gave us a method to evaluate integrals without using Riemann sums. The drawback of this method, though, is that we must be able to find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this section we examine a technique, called integration by substitution, to help us find antiderivatives. Specifically, this method helps us find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result of a chain-rule derivative.

At first, the approach to the substitution procedure may not appear very obvious. However, it is primarily a visual task—that is, the integrand shows you what to do; it is a matter of recognizing the form of the function. So, what are we supposed to see? We are looking for an integrand of the form ∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx For example,in the integral

∫(x² - 3)³2xdx, we have $f(x)=x^{3},g(x)=x^{2}-3$ and g'(x)=2x .Then

f[g(x)]g'(x) = (x²-3)³(2x),

and we see that our intearand is in the correct form.

The method is called substitution because we substitute part of the intearand with the yariable u and part of the integrand with du.It is also referred to as change of variables becausewe are changing variables toobtain an expression that is easier to work with for applying the integration rules

### Theorem 1.7

### Substitution with Indefinite Inteqrals

Let u = g(x) ,where g'(x) is continuous over an interval, let f(x) be continuous over the corresponding range ofg and let $F(x)$ be an antiderivative of $f(x).$ Then

∫ f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = ∫ f(u)du = F(u) + C = F(g(x)) + C

# Proof

Let $f,g,u$, and $F$ be as specified in the theorem.Then

(d/dx)F(g(x))=F'(g(x))g'(x)=f[g(x)]g'(x)

Integrating both sides withrespect to $X.$ we see that

∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = F(g(x))+C

If we now substitute u = g(x), and du=g'(x)dx, we get

∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = ∫f(u)du = F(u) + C = F(g(x)) + C.

口

Returning to the problem we looked at originally,we let $u=x^{2}-3$ and then $du=2xdx$ .Rewrite the integral in terms of u:

∫(x²-3)(2xdx)=∫u³du

Using the power rule for integrals, we have

∫u³du=u⁴/4+C

Substitute the original expression for $x$ back into the solution:

u⁴/4+C=(x²-3)⁴/4+C

We can generalize the procedure in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

## Problem-Solving Strategye

### Integration by Substitution

1.Look carefully at the integrand and select an expression g(x) within the integrand to set equal to u. Let's select g(x) such that g'(x) is also part of the integrand. 2. Substitute u = g(x) and du = g'(x)dx into the integral. 3.We should now be able to evaluate the integral with respect to u. If the integral can't be evaluated we need to go back and select a different expression to use as u 4.Evaluate the integral in terms of u 5.Write the result in terms of $x$ and the expression g(x)

# EXAMPLE 1.30

### Using Substitution to Find an Antiderivative

Use substitutionto fin the antiderivativee ∫6x(3x²+4)⁴dx

### Solution

The first step is to choose an expression for $U$ We choose $u=3x^{2}+4$ because then $du=6xdx$ ,and we already have du in the inteqrand.Write the inteqral in terms of u

∫6x(3x²+4)⁴dx = ∫u⁴du.

Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for $U_r$ regardless of what is inside the integrand. Now we can evaluate the intearal with respect to u

∫u⁴du=u⁵/5+C

=(3x²+4)⁵/5+C

### $⑥$ Analysis

We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We should obtain the integrand. Picking a value for $C$ of 1, we let y = (3x² + 4) + 1. We have

y=(1/5)(3x²+4)⁵+1

SO

y = (1/5)5(3x² + 4)⁴6x = 6x(3x² + 4)⁴

 This is exactly the expression we started with inside the integrand.

1.25 Use substitution to find the antiderivative
∫3x²(x³-3)²dx

Sometimes we need to adjust the constants in our integral if they don't match up exactly with the expressions we are substituting.

### EXAMPLE 1.31

### Using Substitution with Alteration Use substutionto find ∫z√(z²-5)dz

### のSolution

Rewrite the integral as / z(z2 - 5)1² dz. Let $u=z^{2}-5$ and $du= 2z$ $dz$ .Now we have a problem because $du=2z$ dz and the original expressionhas only zdz We have to alter our expression for du or the integral in u will be twice as large as it should be. If we multiply both sides of the du equation by 1/2 we can solve this problem. Thus,

u = z² - 5, du = 2z dz, (1/2)du = z dz

Write the integral in terms of $U_r$ but pull the 1/2 outside the integration symbol

∫z(z²−5)^1/2dz=1/2∫u^1/2du

Integrate the expression in u:

(1/2)∫u¹ᐟ²du = (1/2)(2/3)u³/²+C = (1/3)u³/²+C = (1/3)(z²-5)³/²+C

 12 Usesustutio to indl ∫x²(x³+5)⁹dx

### EXAMPLE 1.32

### Using Substitution with Integrals of Trigonometric Functions Use sustutin o vauate te itegra ∫(sin t)/(cos³t)dt

### Solution

We know the derivative of cost is-sint,soweset u= $u=$ u = cos t . Then $du=$ -sinrdt. Substituting into the integral,we hav

∫sin t/cos³t dt = -∫du/u³

Evaluating the integral, we get

-∫du/u³ = -∫u⁻³du = (1/2)u⁻² + C

Putting the answer back in terms of $t_n$ we get

∫(sin t/cos³t)dt = 1/(2u²) + C = 1/(2cos²t) + C

Use sustiution o evalate the intgla ∫cos t/sin²t dt

Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than just multiplying or dividing by a constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When we are done, u should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the original variable in terms of u.This technique should become clear in the next example.

### EXAMPLE 1.33

### Finding an Antiderivative Using u-Substitution Use ston n ∫x/√(x-1)dx

### If we let $u=x-1$ ,then $du=dx$ .But this does not account for the $x$ in the numerator of the integrand.We need to

express xin terms of $u.$ If $u=x-1$ ,then $x=u+1.$ Nowwecanrewrite the integral in termsof u

∫x/√(x-1)dx = ∫(u+1)/√u du = ∫√u+1/√u du = ∫(u^(1/2)+u^(-1/2))du

Then we integrate in the usual way, replace u with the original expression, and factor and simplify the result. Thus
∫(u¹⁄²+u⁻¹⁄²)du = (2/3)u³/²+2u¹⁄²+C = (2/3)(x-1)³/²+2(x-1)¹⁄²+C = (x-1)¹⁄²[(2/3)(x-1)+2]+C = (x-1)¹⁄²((2/3)x+4/3) = (2/3)(x-1)¹⁄²(x+2)+C.

 128Usesubstitution t evaluate theindefinit integra / cosrsin d?

### Substitution for Definite Integrals

Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However using substitution to evaluate a definite integral requires a change to the limits of integration.If we change variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well

### Theorem 1.8

### Substitution with Definite Integrals

Let u = g(x) and let g' be continuous over an interval $[a,b]$, and let fbe continuous over the range of u = g(x) Then,

∫ₐᵇ f(g(x))g'(x)dx = ∫g(a)g(b) f(u)du

Althouqh we will not formally prove this theorem,we justify it with some calculations here.From the substitution rule for indefinite integrals, if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f( x)$ , wehave

∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx=F(g(x))+C

Then


15. ∫ₐᵇ f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = F(g(x))|ₓ=ₐˣ=ᵇ = F(g(b)) - F(g(a)) = F(u)|ᵤ=g(a)ᵤ=g(b)

—o

and we have the desired result

### EXAMPLE 1.34

### Using Substitution to Evaluate a Definite Integral

Use substitutin t evalate ∫₀¹x²(1+2x³)^5dx

### $②$ Solution Let $u=1+2x^{3}$ ,So $du=6x^{2}dx.$ Since the original function includes one factor of $x^2$ and $du=6x^{2}dx$, multiply both

sides of the du equation by 1/6 .Then,

du=6x²dx, (1/6)du=x²dx

To adjust the limits of integration,note that when 
x=0, u=1+2(0)=1 ,and when $x=1,u=1+2(1)=3$ Then

∫₀¹x²(1+2x³)^5dx = (1/6)∫₁³u⁵du

Evaluating this expression, we get

1/6∫₁³u⁵du = (1/6)(u⁶/6)|₁³ = 1/36[(3)⁶ - (1)⁶] = 182/9.

12 Use substution t evaluae the definite integral y(2y2 3) dy

### EXAMPLE 1.35

### Using Substitution with an Exponential Function Usesustuton t evalate ∫₀¹xe⁴ˣ²+³dx

Let $u=4x^{2}+3$ Then, $du=8xdx.$ To adjust the limits of integration, we note that when $x=0,u=3$ , and when

$x=1,u=7.$ So our substitution gives

∫₀¹ xe⁴ˣ²+³ dx = (1/8)∫₃⁷ eᵘ du = (1/8)eᵘ|₃⁷ = (e⁷ - e³)/8 ≈ 134.568

1.30 Use substitution to evaluat
e∫₀¹ x²cos(π/2x³)dx

Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral. All of the properties and rules of integration apply independently, and trigonometric functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity before we can apply substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for u after we find the antiderivative, which means that we do not have to change the limits of integration. These two approaches are shown in Example 1.36

### EXAMPLE 1.36

### Using Substitution to Evaluate a Trigonometric Integra Use sustutin o valate ∫₀^π/₂cos²θ dθ

Let us frst use a trigonometric identity to rewrite the integral.The trig identity cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 allows us to rewrite the

integral as

∫₀^π/₂cos²θdθ = ∫₀^π/₂(1+cos2θ)/2dθ

Then,

∫₀^π/₂(1+cos2θ)/2dθ=∫₀^π/₂(1/2+1/2cos2θ)dθ

=(1/2)∫₀^(π/2)dθ+(1/2)∫₀^(π/2)cos2θdθ.

We can evaluate the first integral as it is, but we need to make a substitution to evaluate the second integral. Let u=2θ Then, du = 2dθ ,or 1/2du=dθ Also, when θ=0, u=0 , and when θ=π/2, u=π Expressing the second integral in terms

of $u$ we have

(1/2)∫₀^π/²dθ + (1/2)∫₀^π/²cos2θdθ = π/4

1.6 Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

### Learning Objectives

1.6.1 Integrate functions involving exponential functions. 1.6.2 Integrate functions involving logarithmic functions.

Exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model population growth, cell growth, and financial growth, as well as depreciation, radioactive decay, and resource consumption, to name only a few applications. In this section, we explore integration involving exponential and logarithmic functions

## Integrals of Exponential Functions

The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential function, $y=e^{x}$ , is its own derivative and its own integral

### Rule: Inteqrals of Exponential Functions

Exponential functions can be integrated using the following formulas.

∫eˣdx=eˣ+C; ∫aˣdx=aˣ/lna+C

# EXAMPLE 1.37

### Finding an Antiderivative of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function $e^{-x}$

![](./images/f1ms1ic092YMHbAHRgI5e87NibLsh1lCG.png)

### Solution

Use substitution, setting $u=-x$ , and then $du=-1dx$ .Multiply the du equation by -1, so you now have $-du=dx$ .Then,

∫e⁻ˣdx = -∫eᵘdu = -eᵘ + C = -e⁻ˣ + C

Find the antiderivative of the function using substitution: $x^2e^{-2x^3}$ 1.31

A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on $e$ the same way we treat exponents in polynomial expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can be especially confusing when we have both exponentials and polynomials in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In these cases, we should always double-check to make sure we're using the right rules for the functions we're integrating.

### EXAMPLE 1.38

### Square Root of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function eˣ√(1+eˣ)

![](./images/fX3QiykvwDy4ioLRiBerqF91y2IlgMHtB.png)

### Solution

First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent

∫eˣ√(1+eˣ)dx = ∫eˣ(1+eˣ)¹⁄²dx

Using substitution, choose $u=1+e^{x}$ .Then, $du=e^{x}dx.$ We have (Figure 1.37)

∫eˣ(1+eˣ)^½dx=∫u^½du.

Then

## Using Substitution with an Exponential Function Use sustutionto valuatethe ndeiniteintegle ∫3x²e²ˣ³ $dx$

![](./images/fpRxHcKZ7WGTXNUHooVPO32glkkyGap9m.png)

### Solution Here we choose tolet u equal the expression in the exponent on e.Let $u=2x^{3}$ and $du=6x^{2}dx.$ Again,duis off by 

constant multiplier; the original functioncontains a factor of $3x^2$ not $6x^2$ .Multiply both sides of the equation by 1/2 So that the integrand in u equals the integrand in $x.$ Thus

∫3x²e²ˣ³dx=(1/2)∫eᵘdu

Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in $x$ back into the u integral

1/2∫e^u du = 1/2e^u + C = 1/2e^(2x³) + C

 13 Evalate th indefit integral/ 2 a* dx

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are used in many real-life applications. The number e is often associated with compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections about the derivative. Although the derivative represents a rate of change or a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total growth. Let's look at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application.

A price-demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the product. In general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price-demand function is the derivative of the price-demand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in business to determine the price-elasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether changing production levels would be profitable.

# EXAMPLE 1.40

### Finding a Price-Demand Equation

Find the price-demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is 50 tubes per week at <2.35$ per tube, given that the marginal price—demand function, p'(x)  ,for x number of tubes per week, is given as

p'(x) = -0.015e⁻⁰·⁰¹ˣ

If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?

### $②$ Solution

To find the price-demand equation, integrate the marginal price-demand function. First find the antiderivative, then look at the particulars. Thus,

p(x) =∫-0.015e⁻⁰·⁰¹ˣdx =-0.015∫e⁻⁰·⁰¹ˣdx.

Using substitution, let $u=-0.01x$ and $du=-0.01dx$ Then, divide both sides of the $du$ equation by -0.01. This give

(-0.015)/(-0.01)∫eᵘ du = 1.5∫eᵘ du = 1.5eᵘ + C = 1.5e⁻⁰·⁰¹ˣ + C.

The next step is to solve for C. We know that when the price is <2.35$ per tube,the demand is 50 tubes per week.Thi means

p(50) = 1.5e⁻⁰·⁰¹(⁵⁰) + C = 2.35

Now, just solve for C

C = 2.35 - 1.5e⁻⁰·⁵ = 2.35 - 0.91 = 1.44

Thus,

$$p(x)=1.5e^{-0.01x}+1.44.$$

If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be

p(100)=1.5e⁻⁰·⁰¹⁽¹⁰⁰⁾+1.44=1.5e⁻¹+1.44≈1.99

The supermarket should charge <1.99$ per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

### EXAMPLE 1.41

### Evaluating a Definite Integral Involving an Exponential Function EValate te deiteint graa ∫₁²e¹⁻ˣdx

## $②$ Solution

Again, substitution is the method to use. Let $u=1-x$ so $du=-1dx$ or $-du=dx$ . Then el-× dx = - e"du. Nex change the limits of integration. Using the equation $u=1-x$ ,we have

The inteqral then becomes

u=1-(1)=0; u=1-(2)=-1

∫₁²e¹⁻ˣdx = -∫₀⁻¹eᵘdu = ∫₋₁⁰eᵘdu = eᵘ|₋₁⁰ = e⁰ - e⁻¹ = -e⁻¹ + 1

## See Figure 1.38.

Figure 1.38 The indicated area can be calculated by evaluating a definite integral using substitution.

### EXAMPLE 1.42

### Growth of Bacteria in a Culture

Suppose the rate of growth of bacteria in a Petri dish is given by $q(t)=3^t$ , where tis given in hours and $q(t)$ is given in thousands of bacteria per hour. If a culture starts with 10,ooo bacteria, find a function $Q(t)$ that gives the number of bacteria in the Petri dish at any time t. How many bacteria are in the dish after 2 hours?

### $(O)$ Solution We have

Q(t)=∫3ᵗ dt = 3ᵗ/ln3 + C

Then, at $t=0$ we have Q(0) = 10 =+ C, so 
C ≈ 9.090 and we get

Q(t)=3ᵗ/ln3+9.090

At time $t=2$ , we have

Q(2) = 3²/ln3 + 9.090 = 17.282

After 2 hours. there are 17.282 bacteria in the dish

![](./images/frwF7VIunVKeiscBXqbphOVMIRCd3vPBy.png)

1.35 From Example 1.42, suppose the bacteria grow at a rate of $q(t)=2^f$ . Assume the culture still starts with 10,000 bacteria. Find Q(t). How many bacteria are in the dish after 3 hours?

### EXAMPLE 1.43

### Fruit Fly Population Growth Suppose a population of fruit flies increases at a rate of $g(t)=2e^{0.02t}$ , in flies per day. If the initial population of fruit flies

is 100 flies, how many flies are in the population after 10 days？

### Solution

Let $G(t)$ represent the number of flies in the population at time t. Applying the net change theorem, we have

G(10)=G(0)+∫_0^10 2e^0.02t dt = 100+[2/0.02e^0.02t]_0^10 = 100+[100e^0.02t]_0^10 = 100+100e^0.2-100 ≈122.

There are 122 flies in the population after 10 days.

![](./images/fiSDEAYUK4X11UZraPVktXDzg2M4z9Yiv.png)

1.36 Suppose the rate of growth of the fly population is given by $g(t)=e^{0.01t}$ and the initial fly population is 100 flies. How many flies are in the population after 15 days?

## EXAMPLE 1.44

### Evaluating a Definite Integral Using Substitution alate t si ∫₁²e^(1/x)/x²dx

### Solution

This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of $x$, then bring the $x^2$ in the denominator up to thenumeratorusing a negativeexponent.We have

∫_1²e^(1/x)/x²dx=∫_1²e^(x⁻¹ )x⁻²dx

Let $u=x^{-1}$ ,the exponent on e.Then

du=-x⁻²dx, -du=x⁻²dx

Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads

-∫eᵘ du

Next, change the limits of integration:

u=(1)⁻¹=1 u=(2)⁻¹=1/2.

Notice that now the limits begin with the larqer number meaning we must multiply by -1 and interchange the limits Thus,

-\int_{1}^{1/2}e^{\mu}du = \int_{1/2}^{1}e^{u}du = e^{\mu}|_{1/2}^{1} = e-e^{1/2} = e-\sqrt{e}.

### Integrals Involving Logarithmic Functions.

Integrating functions of the form $f(x)=x^{-1}$ result in the absolute value of the natural log function, as shown in the following rule. Integral formulas for other logarithmic functions, such as f(x) = ln x and f(x)=logₐx , are also included in the rule.

### Rule: Integration Formulas Involving Logarithmic Functions

The following formulas can be used to evaluate integrals involving logarithmic functions
∫x⁻¹ dx = ln|x| + C ∫ln x dx = x ln x - x + C = x(ln x - 1) + C ∫logₐx dx = x/(ln a)(ln x - 1) + C

### EXAMPLE 1.45

 Finding an Antiderivative Involving In x Find the antiderivative of the function 3/(x-10)

![](./images/fiG03fe9hMRVLghN9e3F6SvsyZgmK7nhl.png)

First factor the 3 outside the integral symbol. Then use the $u^{-1}$ rule. Thus
∫(3/(x-10))dx = 3∫(1/(x-10))dx = 3∫(du/u) = 3ln|u|+C = 3ln|x-10|+C, x≠10

### See Figure 1.39

Figure 1.39 The domain of this function is x≠10

1.38Find the antiderivative of 2

### EXAMPLE 1.46

### Finding an Antiderivative of a Rational Function Find te antiderivtive of (2x³+3x)/(x⁴+3x²)

Solution

This can be rewritten as /(2x²+ 3x)(x4+3x²)dx.Use substitution. Let $u=x^{4}+3x^{2}$, then $du=4x^{3}+6x.$ Alter du by factoring out the 2. Thus

du=(4x³+6x)dx=2(2x³+3x)dx, (1/2)du=(2x³+3x)dx.

Rewrite the integrand in u:

∫(2x³+3x)(x⁴+3x²)⁻¹dx = (1/2)∫u⁻¹du

Then we have

(1/2)∫u⁻¹du = (1/2)ln|u| + C = (1/2)ln|x⁴ + 3x²| + C

### EXAMPLE 1.47

Finding an Antiderivative of a Logarithmic Function Find the antiderivative of the log function log₂x

### Solution

Follow the format in the formula listed in the rule on inteqration formulas involving logarithmic functions.Based on this format, we have

∫log₂xdx=(x/ln2)(lnx-1)+C

Example 1.48 is a definite integral of a trigonometric function. With trigonometric functions, we often have to apply a trigonometric property or an identity before we can move forward. Finding the right form of the integrand is usually the key to a smooth integration.

### EXAMPLE 1.48

### Evaluating a Definite Integral id the eniteinega ∫₀^π⁄₂(sin x)/(1 + cos x)dx

### Solution

We need substitution to evaluate this problem. Let u=1+cos x, ,SO du = -sin x $dx.$ Rewrite the integral in terms of u, changing the limits of integration as well. Thus,

u=1+cos(0)=2; u=1+cos(π/2)=1

Then

∫_0^(π/2) sinx/(1+cosx) dx=-∫_2^1 u⁻¹ du

∫₁²u⁻¹du = ln|u|₁² = [ln2 - ln1] = ln2

# 1.7 Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions

### Learning Objectives

1.7.1 Integrate functions resulting in inverse trigonometric functions

In this section we focus on integrals that result in inverse trigonometric functions. We have worked with these functions before. Recall from Functions and Graphs (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/1-introduction) that trigonometric functions are not one-to-one unless the domains are restricted. When working with inverses of trigonometric functions, we always need to be careful to take these restrictions into account. Also in Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-introduction), we developed formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. The formulas developed there give rise directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.

## Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions

Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along with these formulas, we use substitution to evaluate the integrals. We prove the formula for the inverse sine integral.

Rule: Inteqration Formulas Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The following integration formulas yield inverse trigonometric functions. Assume $a>0$

1.

∫du/√(a²-u²) = (1/a)sin⁻¹(u/|a|)+C

2.

∫du/(a²+u²) = (1/a)tan⁻¹(u/a) + C

3.

∫du/(u√(u²-a²))=1/|a|sec⁻¹(|u|/a)+C

### Proof Let y=sin⁻¹(x/a) . Then asin $y=x$ .Now let's use implicit differentiation. We obtain

d/dx(asin y) = d/dx(x); acos y(dy/dx) = 1; dy/dx = 1/(acos y)

For -π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, cos y ≥ 0 cos y ≥ 0 cos y≥0 Thus, applying the Pythagorean identity sin²y+cos²y=1 , we have cos y=√(1-sin²y) This gives

1/(a cos y) = 1/(a√(1-sin²y)) = 1/√(a²-a²sin²y) = 1/√(a²-x²)

Then for  -a≤x≤a  , and generalizing to uμ we have

∫(1/√(a²-u²))du = sin⁻¹(u/a) + C.

口

### EXAMPLE 1.49

### Evaluating a Definite Integral Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions Ses ∫₀¹⁄₂dx/√(1-x²)

### $②$ Solution

We can go directly to the formula for the antiderivative in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions, and then evaluate the definite integral. We have



∫₀^√(3)/₂ 1/√(1-u²) du = sin⁻¹u|₀^√(3)/₂ = [sin⁻¹(√(3)/₂)] - [sin⁻¹(0)] = π/3.

## Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions.

There are six inverse trigonometric functions.However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out -1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function.

### EXAMPLE 1.52

### Finding an Antiderivative Involving the Inverse Tangent Function

Evlate th integral ∫1/(1+4x²)dx

## $②$ Solution

Comparing this problem with the formulas stated in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions, the integrand looks similar to the formula for tan⁻¹u+C. So we use substitution, letting $u=2x$ ,then $du=2dx$ and $1/2du=dx$ Then, we have

(1/2)∫1/(1+u²)du=(1/2)tan⁻¹u+C=(1/2)tan⁻¹(2x)+C

### Key Concepts

### 1.1 Approximating Areas

·For a continuous function defined over an interval $[a,b]$ , the process of dividing the interval into n equal parts, extending a rectangle to the graph of the function, calculating the areas of the series of rectangles, and then summing the areas yields an approximation of the area of that region. ·The width of each rectangle is Δx = (b - a)/n Rieman ums ae e resons f te oto ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ*)Δx an an be ued t stimal th ara ndethe eun

$y=f(x)$ Left- and right-endpoint approximations are special kinds of Riemann sums where the values of {xᵢ*} are chosen to be the left or right endpoints of the subintervals, respectively Riemann sums allow for much flexibility in choosing the set of points {xᵢ*} at which the function is evaluated, often with an eye to obtaining a lower sum or an upper sum.

## 1.2 The Definite Integral

·The definite integral can be used to calculate net signed area, which is the area above the x-axis less the area below the x-axis. Net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. ·The component parts of the definite integral are the integrand, the variable of integration, and the limits of integration. Continuous functions on a closed interval are integrable. Functions that are not continuous may still be integrable depending on the nature of the discontinuities ·The properties of definite integrals canbe used to evaluate integrals. ·The area under the curve of many functions can be calculated using geometricformulas. ·The average value of a function can be calculated using definite integrals.

## 1.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

·The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that for a continuous function over a closed interval, there is a value such that $f$ (c) equals the average value of the function. See The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals ·The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 1 shows the relationship between the derivative and the integral.See Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 1 •The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 is a formula for evaluating a definite integral in terms of an antiderivative of its integrand. The total area under a curve can be found using this formula. See The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.

## 1.4 Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem

·The net change theorem states that when a quantity changes, the final value equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change. Net change can be a positive number, a negative number, or zero. ·The area under an even function over a symmetric interval can be calculated by doubling the area over the positive x-axis. For an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval equals zero, because halfthe area is negative.

### 1.5 Substitution

Substitution is a technique that simplifies the integration of functions that are the result of a chain-rule derivative The term‘substitution'refers to changing variables or substituting the variable u and du for appropriate expressions in the integrand. ·When using substitution for a definite integral, we also have to change the limits of integration

## 1.6 Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

 Exponential and logarithmic functions arise in many real-world applications, especially those involving growth and decay. ·Substitution is often used to evaluate integrals involving exponential functions or logarithms

## 1.7 Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions.

 Formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions developed in Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-7-derivatives-of-inverse-functions) lead directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions. •Use the formulas listed in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions to match up the correct format and make alterations as necessary to solve the problem Substitution is oftenrequired toput the integrand in thecorrect form.

## Introduction

The Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel. When Lake Mead, the reservoir behind the dam, is full, the dam withstands a great deal of force. However, water levels in the lake vary considerably as a result of droughts and varying water demands. Later in this chapter, we use definite integrals to calculate the force exerted on the dam when the reservoir is full and we examine how changing water levels affect that force (see Example 2.28).

Hydrostatic force is only one of the many applications of definite integrals we explore in this chapter. From geometric applications such as surface area and volume, to physical applications such as mass and work, to growth and decay models, definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand and model the world around us.

# 2.1 Areas between Curves.

## Learning Objectives

2.1.1Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to the independent variable 2.1.2 Find the area of a compound region 2.1.3Determine the area of a reqionbetween two curves byinteqrating withrespect to the dependen variable

In Introduction to Inteqration,we developed the concept of the definite inteqral to calculate the area below a curve on a given interval. In this section, we expand that idea to calculate the area of more complex regions. We start by finding the area between two curves that are functions of $x$ ,beginning with the simple case in which one function value is always greater than the other. We then look at cases when the graphs of the functions cross.Last, we consider how to calculate the area between two curves that are functions of $y$

# Area of a Region between Two Curves

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions over an interval $[a,b]$ such that f(x) ≥ g(x) on $[a,b].$ We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fTrHXB6neHXDIXixOtO1COO66dPXBRLtu.png)

Figure 2.2 The area between the graphs of two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,on the interval $[a,b]$

As we did before,we are going to partition the interval on the $x$ -axis and approximate the area between the graphs of the functions with rectangles. So, for i=0,1,2,…,n let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ . Then, for i = 1, 2, ..., n choose a point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], and on each interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] construct a rectangle that extends vertically from $g(x_i^*$ to $f(x_i^*)$ Figure 2.3(a) shows the rectangles when $x_i^{*}$ is selected to be the left endpoint of the interval and $n=10$ Figure 2.3(b) shows a representative rectangle in detail.

Figure 2.3 (a)We can approximate the area between the graphs of two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,with rectangles. (b) The area ofa typicalrectanqle qoes from onecurve to the other

The height of each individual rectangle is $f(x_{i}^{n})-g(x_{i}^{*})$ and the width of each rectangle is Δx . Adding the areas of all the rectangles, we see that the area between the curves is approximated by

A ≈ ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ [f(xᵢ*) - g(xᵢ*)]Δx

This is a Riemann sum, so we take the limit as n → 00 and we get

A = limₙ→∞Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ[f(xᵢ*) - g(xᵢ*)]Δx = ∫ₐᵇ[f(x) - g(x)]dx

These findings are summarized in the following theorem

### Theorem 2.1

### Finding theArea between Two Curves

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions such that f(x) ≥ g(x) over an interval $[a,b]$ . Let $R$ denote the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ,below by the graph of $g(x)$ , and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ ano $x=b$ ,respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A = ∫ₐᵇ[f(x) - g(x)]dx

We apply this theorem in the following example.

# EXAMPLE 2.1

### Finding the Area of a Region between Two Curves 1

If $R$ is the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=x+4$ and below by the graph of thefunctior g(x) = 3 - x/2 over the interval [1, 4] , find the area of region $R$

### $②$ Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure.

Figure 2.4 Aregion between two curves is shown where one curve is always greater than the other.

We have



A=∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx =∫₋₂⁶[9-(x/2)²-(6-x)]dx=∫₋₂⁶[3-x²/4+x]dx =[3x-x³/12+x²/2]|₋₂⁶=64/3

The area of the region is 64/3 units2.

![](./images/fCQng7hYV0iyIsK4IYX4g3DmgDap1860a.png)

2.2 If R is the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x)=χ and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=x^4$ find the area of region R.

# Areas of Compound Regions

So far, we have required f(x) ≥ g(x) over the entire interval of interest,but what if we want to look at regions bounded by the graphs of functions that cross one another? In that case, we modify the process we just developed by using the absolute value function.

### Theorem 2.2

### Finding the Area of a Reqion between Curves That Cross

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ becontinuous functions over an interval $[a,b]$ . Let $R$ denote the region between the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ , and be bounded on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A = ∫ₐᵇ|f(x) - g(x)|dx

In practice, applying this theorem requires us to break up the interval $[a,b]$ and evaluate several integrals, depending on which of the function values is greater over a given part of the interval. We study this process in the following example.

### EXAMPLE 2.3

### Finding the Area of a Region Bounded by Functions That Cross

If $R$ is the region between the graphs of the functions. f(x) = sin x and g(x)=cos x over the interval [0,π] , find the area of region $R$

![](./images/fDLrXH7avKwO33FissQcah8dlyISnY3KQ.png)

### Solution

![](./images/fXpLv6uw042ykY8fHgX7kZfHnkkgR9tLo.png)

Figure 2.6 The region between two curves can be broken into two sub-regions

The graphs of the functions intersect at x = π/4 For x∈[0,π/4] x∈[0,π/4] x ∈ [0, π/4], cos x ≥ sin x, 60

|f(x)-g(x)| = |sin x - cos x| = cos x - sin x.

On the other hand, for x ∈ [π/4, π] , sin x ≥ cos x SC

|f(x)-g(x)| = |sin x - cos x| = sin x - cos x.

Then

A = ∫ₐᵇ|f(x) - g(x)| dx = ∫₀^π|sin x - cos x| dx = ∫₀^π/₄(cos x - sin x) dx + ∫π/₄^π(sin x - cos x) dx = [sin x + cos x]|₀^π/₄ + [-cos x - sin x]|π/₄^π = (√2 - 1) + (1 + √2) = 2√2

The area of the region is 2√2 units2

![](./images/fitNPdhpMzcZRkr7VH4AywOa6Ifel5F7o.png)

If R is the region between the graphs of the functions f(x) = sin x f(x) = sin x f(x) = sin x and g(x)=cos x g(x) = cos x g(x)=cos x over the interva [π/2, 2π] find the area of region R.

### EXAMPLE 2.4

### Finding the Area of a Complex Region

Consider the region depicted in Eigure 2.7. Find the area of $R$

![](./images/fC32E3lm6ktWW53kHeF6mLnfmHegP839L.png)

Figure 2.7 Two integrals are required to calculate the area of this region

![](./images/fNIDSOIFNOCFBkSX24GoWw47SYR1ssleo.png)

### Solution

As with Example 2.3, we need to divide the interval into two pieces. The graphs of the functions intersect at $x=1$ (se $f(x)=g(x)$ and solve for x), so we evaluate two separate integrals: one over the interval [0, 1] and one over the interval [1,2].

Over the interval [0, 1], the region is bounded above by $f(x)=x^{2}$ and below by the $x.$ axis, so we have

A₁=∫₀¹x²dx=(x³/3)|₀¹=1/3

Over the interval [1,2],the reqion is bounded above by $g(x)=2-x$ andbelowby the X -axis, so we have

A₂ = ∫₁²(2-x)dx = [2x - x²/2]|₁² = 1/2

Adding these areas together, we obtain

A=A₁+A₂=1/3+1/2=5/6.

The area of the region is 5/6 units2.

Consider the region depicted in the following figure. Find the area of R

![](./images/f4VAg47GYs8fNGLFcT0L2kglA7obVovpH.png)

# Regions Defined with Respect to y

In Example 2.4, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of $y$ ,instead of as functions of $X$ Review Eigure 2.7. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function $y=f(x)=x^{2}.$ We could just as easily solve this for $x$ and represent the curve by the function x = v(y) = √y . (Note that x=-√y is also a valid representation of the function $y=f(x)=x^{2}$ as a function of y. However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function $y=g(x)=2-x$ ,but could just as easily be represented by the function $x=u(y)=2-y$ When the graphs are represented as functions of $y$ we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function.Therefore, if we integrate with respect to $y$ , we need to evaluate one integral only. Let's develop a formula for this type of integration.

Let $u(y)$ and υ(y) be continuous functions over an interval [c, d] such that u(y) ≥ v(y) for all y∈[c,d] We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fTFg62Is5v20I1n4C1Caa7nfmOt3oKvwB.png)

Figure 2.8 We can find the area between the graphs of two functions, $u(y)$ and $v(y)$

This time, we are going to partition the interval on the $y$ -axis and use horizontal rectangles to approximate the area between the functions. So, for i = 0 $i=0$ i=0,1,2,…,n let Q = {yᵢ} be a regular partition of [c, d] . Then, for $i=1,2,...,n$ choose a point yᵢ*∈[yᵢ₋₁,yᵢ] ,then over each interval [yᵢ₋₁, yᵢ] construct a rectangle that extends horizontally from v(yᵢ*) to u(yᵢ*) . Figure 2.9(a) shows the rectangles when $y_i^*$ is selected to be the lower endpoint of the interval and $n=10.$ Figure 2.9(b) shows a representative rectangle in detail.

Figure 2.9 (a) Approximating the area between the graphs of two functions, ιι(y) and v(y), with rectangles. (b) The area of a typical rectangle.

The height of each individual rectangle is Δy and the width of each rectangle is u(yᵢ*)-v(yᵢ*) Therefore, the area between the curves is approximately

A ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ[u(yᵢ*)-v(yᵢ*)]Δy

This is a Riemann sum, so we take the limit as n→∞ ,obtaining

A=lim_(n→∞)∑_(i=1)^n[u(yᵢ*)-v(yᵢ*)]Δy=∫_(c)^d[u(y)-v(y)]dy

These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.3

Finding the Area between Two Curves, Inteqrating along the y-axis

Let $u(y)$ and υ(y) be continuous functions such that u(y) ≥ v(y) for all y∈[c,d] Let $R$ denote the region bounded on the right by the graph of $u(y)$ , on the left by the graph of υ(y) , and above and below by the lines $y=d$ and $y=c$ respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A=∫cᵈ[u(y)-v(y)]dy.

# EXAMPLE 2.5

### Integrating with Respect to y

Let's revisit Example 2.4, only this time let's integrate with respect to $y.$ Let $R$ be the region depicted in Eigure 2.10. Find the area of $R$ by integrating with respect to $y$

![](./images/fXC6pmsoB9sPH53P7Bx7tz4fNIRcuGNcE.png)

Figure 2.10 The area of region $R$ can be calculated using one integral only when the curves are treated as functions of y.

### $①$ Solution

We must first express the graphs as functions of $y$ .As we saw at the beginning of this section, the curve on the left can be represented by the function x = v(y) = √y and the curve on the right can be represented by the function
$$x=u(y)=2-y.$$

Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is $y=0$ . The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the point (1,1) , so the upper limit of integration is $y=1$ , Thus, we have $[c,d]=[0,1]$

Calculating the area of the region, we get

# 2.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing

## Learning Objectives

2.2.1 Determine the volume of a solid by integrating a cross-section (the slicing method) 2.2.2 Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the disk method 2.2.3Find thevolume of a solid of revolution with a cavity usinq the washer method

In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section, we use definite integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches-slicing, disks, and washersfor finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid

# Volume and the Slicing Method

Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a threedimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a rectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height: $V=lwh.$ The formulas for the volume of a sphere( V = (4/3)πr⁵ ), a cone V = (⅓πr²h) ,and a pyramid (V=1/3Ah) ) have also been introduced. Although some of these formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration

We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as a soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more general context, we first need to define some vocabulary

We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the cylinder. Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Eigure 2.11 is an example of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross-section by the height of the cylinder: V=A·h In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V = πr²h

![](./images/f3eGTlP2NAYFEOsbtGG58btIBngof1x3i.png)
Figure 2.11 Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.

If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula for its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the solid into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together.The slices should all be parallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the solid S shown in Figure 2.12, extending along the $x$ -axis.

![](./images/fXBh0l90gDrpz5RSLms3y3BGI6rpVtZ3h.png)
Figure 2.12 A solid with a varying cross-section.

We want to divide $S$ into slices perpendicular to the $x$ -axis. As we see later in the chapter, there may be times when we want to slice the solid in some other direction—say, with slices perpendicular to the y-axis. The decision of which way to slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter, we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the $x$ -axis.

Because the cross-sectional area is not constant, we let A(x) represent the area of the cross-section at point $x$ . Now let P̄={x₀,x₁, …, xₙ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ ,and for i = 1, 2, …, n let $S_{i}$ represent the slice of $S$ stretching from $x_{i-1}$ xj1 $x_{i-1}$to $x_i$ Xj $x_{i}$ The following figure shows the sliced solid with $n=3$

![](./images/fnTs7GQFnMlIBtogbmfXwB1U9322OciAT.png)
Figure 2.13 The solid $S$ has been divided into three slices perpendicular to the $x$ -axis

Finally, for i = 1, 2, …, n let $x_i^{*}$ be an arbitrary point in [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ]. Then the volume of slice $S_i$ can be estimated by V(Sᵢ)≈A(xᵢ*)Δx Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the entire solid $S$ can be approximated by

V(S) ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ A(xᵢ*)Δx

By now, we can recognize this as a Riemann sum, and our next step is to take the limit as n → 00 .Then we have

V(S) = lim_(n→∞) Σ_(i=1)^n A(xᵢ*)Δx = ∫_a^b A(x)dx.

The technique we have just described is called the slicing method. To apply it, we use the following strategy.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Finding Volumes by the Slicing Method

1.Examine the solid and determine the shape of a cross-section of the solid. It is often helpful to draw a picture if one is not provided 2.Determine a formula for the area of the cross-section. 3.Integrate the area formula over the appropriate interval toget thevolume.

Recall that in this section, we assume the slices are perpendicular to the $X$ -axis.Therefore,the area formula is in terms of x and the limits of integration lie on the $x$ -axis. However, the problem-solving strategy shown here is valid regardless of how we choose to slice the solid.

## EXAMPLE 2.6

### Deriving the Formula for the Volume of a Pyramid

We know from geometry that the formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = (1/3)Ah. If the pyramid has a square base, this becomes V=(1/3)a²h ,where a denotes the length of one side of the base.We are going to use the slicing method to derive this formula

## $②$ Solution

We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider the pyramid shown in Fiqure 2.14, oriented along the $x$ -axis

![](./images/fleDx32CK0HM1inGrnKCGB2HEQttiHHqu.png)
Figure 2.14 (a) A pyramid with a square base is oriented along the x-axis. (b) A two-dimensional view of the pyramid is

seen from the side.

We first want to determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. We know the base is a square, so the crosssections are squares as well (step 1). Now we want to determine a formula for the area of one of these cross-sectional squares. Looking at Figure 2.14(b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have

s/a = x/h or s = ax/h

Therefore. the area of one of the cross-sectional sauares is

A(x)=s²=(ax/h)²(step 2).

Thenwefind thevolume of thepyramid by integrating from 0 to h (step 3)

V=∫₀ʰA(x)dx=∫₀ʰ(ax/h)²dx=(a²/h²)∫₀ʰx²dx=[(a²/h²)(1/3x³)]|₀ʰ=1/3a²h

This is the formula we were looking for.

√2  2.6 Use the slicing method to derive the formula V = (1/3)πr²h for the volume of a circular cone

## Solids of Revolution

If a reqion in a plane is revolved around a line in that plane, the resulting solid is called a solid of revolution,as shown ir the following figure.

![](./images/fKYz17wbrmqe0VV5LTgg3giOykFiES5Bn.png)
Figure 2.15 (a) This is the region that is revolved around the x-axis. (b) As the region begins to revolve around the axis, it

sweeps out a solid of revolution. (c) This is the solid that results when the revolution is complete.

Solids of revolution are common in mechanical applications, such as machine parts produced by a lathe. We spend the rest of this section looking at solids of this type.The next example uses the slicing method to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution.

## EXAMPLE 2.7

### Using the Slicing Method to find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution

Use the slicing method to find the volume of the solid of revolution bounded by the graphs of f(x)=x²-4x+5, x=1 , and $x=4$ ,and rotated about the $x$ -axis.

## $②$ Solution

Using the problem-solving strategy, we first sketch the graph of the quadratic function over the interval [1, 4] as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fKtdnAkG4QqVoaZe3USxoKNTDXfvgH2ZU.png)
Figure 2.16 A region used to produce a solid of revolution

Next, revolve the region around the $x.$ axis, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fncHWClgMrDhhQAw0egUFkgmgtboWxTGG.png)
Figure 2.17 Two views, (a) and (b), of the solid of revolution produced by revolving the region in Figure 2.16 about the

$X$ -axis.

Since the solid was formed by revolving the region around the $x$ -axis, the cross-sections are circles (step 1). The area of the cross-section, then, is the area of a circle, and the radius of the circle is given by $f(x)$ Use the formula for the area of the circle:

A(x)=πr²=π[f(x)]²=π(x²−4x+5)²(step 2)

The volume, then, is (step 3)

V = ∫ₐᵇA(x)dx = ∫₁⁴π(x²-4x+5)²dx = π∫₁⁴(x⁴-8x³+26x²-40x+25)dx = π(x⁵/5-2x⁴+26x³/3-20x²+25x)|₁⁴ = 78π/5

The volume is 78π/5

![](./images/fFnI5gZAnVACH7NiMFS0VLSyxrGCZ6Yxw.png)

 Use the method of slicing to find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving the regior between the graph of the function f(x)=1/x and the x-axis over the interval [1, 2] around the x-axis. See the following figure.

![](./images/fLHZx9w4WFESEdf2NYl8AiX3ZSwE3VpQT.png)

### The Disk Method

When we use the slicing method with solids of revolution, it is often called the disk method because,for solids of revolution, the slices used to over approximate the volume of the solid are disks. To see this, consider the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region between the graph of the function $f(x)=(x-1)^{2}+1$ and the $x$ -axis over the interval [-1,3] around the $x$ -axis.The graph of thefunction and a representative disk are shown inFigure 2.18(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 2.18(c) and (d).

![](./images/f6X7d93vzaLCnvg131TSfOuXendy7dKTn.png)
Figure 2.18 (a) A thin rectangle for approximating the area under a curve.(b) A representative disk formed by revolving

the rectangle about the $x$ axis. (c) The region under the curve is revolved about the $x$ -axis, resulting in (d) the solid of revolution.

We already used the formal Riemann sum development of the volume formula when we developed the slicing method. We know that

V = ∫ₐᵇ A(x)dx

The only difference with the disk method is that we know the formula for the cross-sectional area ahead of time; it is the area of a circle.This gives the following rule

### Rule:The Disk Method

Let $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x).$ below by the $X$ -axis, on the left by the line $x=a$ , and on the right by the line $x=b$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolution

formed by revolving $R$ around the X -axis is given by


V = ∫ₐᵇ π[f(x)]²dx

The volume of the solid we have been studying (Figure 2.18) is given by
V = ∫ₐᵇπ[f(x)]²dx = ∫₋₁³π[(x-1)²+1]²dx = π∫₋₁³[(x-1)⁴+2(x-1)²+1]dx = π[1/5(x-1)⁵+2/3(x-1)³+x]|₋₁³ = π[(32/5+16/3+3)-(-32/5-16/3-1)] = 412π/15 units³

Let's look at some examples.

# EXAMPLE 2.8

### Using the Disk Method to Find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution 1

Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region between the graph of f(x) = √x and the $x$ -axis over the interval [1,4] around the $x$ -axis.

### $②$ Solution

The qraphs of the function and the solid of revolution are shown in the following fiqure.

![](./images/fwi3wfqRI9dKGCQhUEBm7RCN6W4FWYp9k.png)
Figure 2.19 (a) The function f(x) = √x over the interval [1,4] . (b) The solid of revolution obtained by revolving the

region under the graph of $f(x)$ about the $X$ -axis.

We have

V =∫ₐᵇπ[f(x)]²dx =∫₁⁴π[√x]²dx=π∫₁⁴x dx = (π/2)x²|₁⁴ = (15π)/2.

The volume is (15π)/2 units3

Sofar,our examples have all concerned regions revolved around the $X$ -axis, but we can generate a solid of revolution by revolving a plane region around any horizontal or vertical line. In the next example, we look at a solid of revolution that has been generated by revolving a region around the. $y$ -axis.The mechanics of the diskmethod are nearly the same as when the $x$ -axis is the axis of revolution, but we express the function in terms of $y$ and we integrate with respect to y as well. This is summarized in the following rule.

### Rule: The Disk Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis.

Let g (y) be continuous and nonnegative. Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of g(y), onthe left by the $y$ -axis, below by the line $y=c$ ,and above by the line $y=d.$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the y-axis is given by

V=∫_c^d π[g(y)]²dy

The next example shows how thisrule works in practice

## EXAMPLE 2.9

### Using the Disk Method to Find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution 2

Let $R$ be the region bounded by the graph of g(y)=√(4-y) and the $y$ axis over the $y$ axis interval [0, 4]. Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating $R$ around the $y$ -axis

![](./images/fmx5byTSvxHqKwfBzgZO8slsFWGGYoGq8.png)

### Solution

Figure 2.20 shows the function and a representative disk that can be used to estimate the volume. Notice that since we are revolving the function around the y-axis, the disks are horizontal, rather than vertical.

![](./images/fCwZIMg01S208Iis01NspSsGqIPaakigx.png)
Figure 2.20 (a) Shown is a thin rectangle between the curve of the function g(y)=√(4-y) and the y-axis. (b) The

rectanqle forms a representative disk after revolution around the y-axis.

The region to be revolved and the full solid of revolution are depicted in the following figure.

![](./images/f3PSTvMmNyVVfSq1FcuVnU0QC1pcdrySa.png)
Figure 2.21 (a) The region to the left of the function g(y)=√(4-y) over the y-axis interval [0, 4] . (b) The solid of

revolution formed by revolving the region about the y-axis.

To find the volume, we integrate with respect to y. We obtain

![](./images/fhetAZ9RqnGrRuDOCzgUVbgdG2poo56xG.png)

The volume is 8π units3

![](./images/fVIsrhhLWAiLAgqeWM8nlyZO3oOWrvSZG.png)

2.9 Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region between the graph of g(y)=y and the y-axis over the interval [1, 4] around the y-axis.

## The Washer Method

Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of revolution. Sometimes this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to the axis of revolution. In other cases cavities arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region between the graphs of two functions. A third way thiscan happen iswhen an axis of revolution other than the $X$ axis or y-axis isselected.

When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are not disks, but washers (disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x) = √x and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=1$ over the interval [1, 4] . When this region is revolved around the X -axis, the result is a solid with a cavity in the middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function and a representative washer are shown in Figure 2.22(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 2.22(c) and (d)

![](./images/frHGyNgvWrBgAZWHlxIpLtw9SML3FdO8d.png)
Figure 2.22 (a) A thin rectangle in the region between two curves.(b) A representative washer formed by revolving the

rectangle about the $x$ -axis.(c) The region between the curves over the given interval.(d) The resulting solid of revolution

The cross-sectional area, then,is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. In this case

A(x) = π(√x)² - π(1)² = π(x-1)

Then the volume of the solid is

V = ∫ₐᵇA(x)dx = ∫₁⁴π(x-1)dx = π[x²/2 - x]|₁⁴ = (9/2)π units³

Generalizing this process gives the washer method

Rule: The Washer Method

Suppose $f(x)$ and g(x) are continuous, nonnegative functions such that. f(x)≥g(x) over $[a,b].$ Let $R$ denote the regionbounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ，below by the graph of g(x) ,on the left by the line $x=a$ and on the right by the line $x=b$ . Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the $x$ -axis is qiver by

V = ∫ₐᵇπ[(f(x))² - (g(x))²]dx

### EXAMPLE 2.10

### Using the Washer Method

Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by the graph of f(x)=x and below by the graph of g(x)=1/x over the interval [1, 4] around the $x$ -axis

![](./images/f4tvqTonqVCGcXA3rglyFBQxVq2iW4OLz.png)

The graphs of the functions and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fg5t7qxeEerr2W89BtnqUGVul3rVg7wgn.png)
Figure 2.23 (a) The region between the graphs of the functions f(x)=x and g(x)=1/x over the interval [1,4]. (b)

Revolving theregion about the $x$ =axis generates a solid of revolution with a cavity in the middle

We have

V =∫ₐᵇπ[(f(x))²-(g(x))²]dx = π∫₁⁴[x²-(1/x)²]dx = π[x³/3+1/x]|₁⁴ = (81π)/4 units³

2.10 Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of f(x) = √x and g $(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1, 3] around the x-axis.

As with the disk method.we can also apply the washer method to solids of revolution that result from revolving a reaion around the y-axis. In this case, the following rule applies.

### Rule:The WasherMethod for Solids of Revolution around they-axis

Suppose $u(y)$ and $v(y)$ are continuous, nonnegative functions such that v(y) ≤ u(y) for y∈[c,d] Let $Q$ denote the region bounded on the right by the graph of $u(y)$ ,on the left by the graph of $v(y)$ , below by the line $y=c$ ,and above by the line $y=d.$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the y-axis is given by

V = ∫_{c}^{d} π[(u(y))² - (v(y))²]dy

Rather than looking at an example of the washer method with the $y$ -axis as the axis of revolution, we now consider an example in which the axis of revolution is a line other than one of the two coordinate axes.The same qeneral methoc applies, but you may have to visualize just how to describe the cross-sectional area of the volume.

## EXAMPLE 2.11

### The Washer Method with a Different Axis of Revolutior

Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by f(x) = 4 - x and belowby the $x$ -axis over the interval [0,4] around the line $y=-2$

Figure 2.24 (a) The region between the graph of the function f(x) = 4 - x andthe $x$ -axis over the interval [0, 4] . (b)

Revolving theregion about the line $y=-2$ generates a solid of revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.

We can't apply the volume formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by $f(x)+2$ , which simplifies to

$$f(x)+2=(4-x)+2=6-x.$$

Theradius of the inner circle is g(x) = 2 . Therefore, we have

V = ∫₀⁴π[(6-x)² - 2²]dx = π∫₀⁴(x²-12x+32)dx = π[x³/3 - 6x² + 32x]|₀⁴ = (160π)/3 units³.

# 2.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

## Learning Objectives

2.3.1Calculate the volume of a solid of revolution by using the method of cylindrical shells 2.3.2Compare the different methods for calculating a volume of revolution

In this section, we examine the method of cylindrical shells, the final method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution. We can use this method on the same kinds of solids as the disk method or the washer method; however, with the disk and washer methods, we integrate along the coordinate axis parallel to the axis of revolution. With the method of cylindrical shells, we integrate along the coordinate axis perpendicularto the axis of revolution. The ability to choose which variable of integration we want to use can be a significant advantage with more complicated functions. Also, the specific geometry of the solid sometimes makes the method of using cylindrical shells more appealing than using the washer method. In the last part of this section, we review all the methods for finding volume that we have studied and lay out some guidelines to help you determine which method to use in a given situation.

# The Method of Cylindrical Shells.

Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region $R$ ,bounded above by the graph of a function $y=f(x)$ ,below by the $X$ -axis,and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively, as shown in Eiqure 2.25(a). We then revolve this region around the y-axis, as shown in Eiqure 2.25(b). Note that this is different from what we have done before.Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of $x$ wererevolved around the $x$ -axis or a line parallel to it.

![](./images/fosfxuLc3wOS2Q2RQDQYViUced93fviHH.png)
Figure 2.25 (a) A region bounded by the graph of a function of x. (b) The solid of revolution formed when the region is

revolved around the y-axis.

As we have done many times before, partition the interval $[a,b]$ using a regular partition, P={x₀,x₁, …, xₙ} and, for i = 1, 2, ..., n choose a point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], Then, construct a rectangle over the interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] of height $f(x_i^*)$ and width Δx . A representative rectangle is shown in Eigure 2.26(a). When that rectangle is revolved around the y-axis instead of a disk or a washer, we get a cylindrical shell, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/f6kcFcFYpvvNFmFKlGaFxQ0bUd8KIOybw.png)
Figure 2.26 (a) A representative rectangle. (b) When this rectangle is revolved around the y-axis, the result is a cylindrical

shell.(c)when we put all the shells toqether we qet an approximation of the oriqinal solid.

To calculate the volume of this shell, consider Figure 2.27

![](./images/fkgzDQRlpRaKaSDbzN2kFe4vFryoM8mcw.png)
Figure 2.27 Calculating the volume of the shell.

The shellis a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections are annuli (ring-shaped regions--essentiall, circles with a hole in the center), with outer radius $x_i$ and inner radius $x_{i-1}$ Thus, the cross-sectional area is πxᵢ²-πxᵢ₋₁². The height of the cylinder is $f(x_i^*)$ . Then the volume of the shell is


Vshell = f(xᵢ*)(πxᵢ² - πxᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ² - xᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁)

Note that xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁ = Δx so we have

V_(shell)=2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2)Δx

Furthermore, (xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2 is both the midpoint of the interval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ and the average radius of the shell, and we can approximate this by $x_i^{n}$ .We then have


V<sub>shell</sub>≈2πf(xᵢ*)xᵢ*Δx

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate (Figure 2.28)

![](./images/fLyGr3riUVZwwsdsCgedpxwZvr5hd96li.png)
Figure 2.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate.

In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height $f(x_i^*)$ ,width 2πxᵢ* , and thickness Δx (Eiqure 2.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get

Vshell≈f(xᵢ*)(2πxᵢ*)Δx

which is the same formula we had before

To calculate the yolume of the entire solid, we then add the yolumes of all the shells and obtair

V≈∑_(i=1)^n(2πxᵢ*f(xᵢ*)Δx)

Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2πxf(x) , Taking the limit as n→∞ gives us

V = limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(2πxᵢ*f(xᵢ*)Δx) = ∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx

This leads to the following rule for the method of cylindrical shells.

### Rule: The Method of Cylindrical Shells

Let $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ,below by the X -axis, on the left by the line $x=a$ ,and on the right by the line $x=b$ Then the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the y-axis is given by

V = ∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx.

Now let's consider an example

# EXAMPLE 2.12

### The Method of Cylindrical Shells 1

Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=1/x$ and below by the $x$ -axis over the interval [1, 3]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving. $R$ around the $y$ -axis.

## $②$ Solution

First we must graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution,as shown in the following figure

![](./images/f3GsR3LrMRytfggh1p5u1QxnhrTuqI3a6.png)
Figure 2.29 (a) The region R under the graph of $f(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1,3].(b) The solid of revolution generated

by revolving $R$ about the y-axis.

Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx = ∫₁³(2πx(1/x))dx = ∫₁³2π dx = 2πx|₁³ = 4π units³. 

2.12 Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ and below by the x-axis over the interval [1, 2] . Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the y-axis.

### EXAMPLE 2.13

![](./images/fviwWziLCongACRFZnIGlIE9GEgbpOkPE.png)

First graph theregion $R$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fIb8gOsAzacmp639EnEbZwtLZBzXSvq94.png)

Figure 2.30 (a) The region $R$ under the graph of $f(x)=2x-x^{2}$ over the interval [0, 2]. (b) The volume of revolution obtained by revolving $R$ about the $y$ -axis.

Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx = ∫₀²(2πx(2x-x²))dx = 2π∫₀²(2x²-x³)dx = 2π[(2x³/3)-(x⁴/4)]|₀² = (8π/3) units³

2.13 Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=3x-x^2$ and below by the $X$ -axis over the interval [0, 2] . Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around the y-axis.

As with the disk method and the washer method, we can use the method of cylindrical shells with solids of revolution revolved around the $x$ -axis,when wewant to integrate with respect to $y.$ The analogous rule for this type of solid is given here.

### Rule: The Method of Cylindrical Shells for Solids of Revolution around the x-axis

Let $g(y)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of $g(y)$ ,on the left by the $y$ -axis, below by the line $y=c$ , and above by the line $y=d.$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the $x$ -axis is given by

V = ∫c^d(2πyg(y))dy

# EXAMPLE 2.14

### The Method of Cylindrical Shells for a Solid Revolved around the x-axis

Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of g(y)=2√y and on the left by the $y$ -axis for y∈[0,4] Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the x-axis.

### $②$ Solution

First, we need to graph the region $Q$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fG9w6gCUwBRqVeIS5ppbPEmWnSPQd7u9s.png)
Figure 2.31 (a) The region $Q$ to the left of the function $g(y)$ over the interval[0,4]. (b) The solid of revolution generated

by revolving $Q$ around the $x$ -axis.

Label the shaded region $Q$ . Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>(2πyg(y))dy = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>(2πy(2√y))dy = 4π∫<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>y<sup>3/2</sup>dy = 4π[2y<sup>5/2</sup>/5]|<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup> = 256π/5 units³

√2  2.14 Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of $g(y)=3/y$ and on the left by the y-axis for y ∈ [1, 3] Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the x-axis.

For the next example,we look at a solid of revolution for which the qraph of a function is revolved around a line other than one of the two coordinate axes.To set this up,we need to revisit the development of the method of cylindrica shells. Recall that we found the volume of one of the shells to be given by

Vshell = f(xᵢ*)(πxᵢ² - πxᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ² - xᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁) = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)

This was based on a shell with an outer radius of $X_{i}$ and an inner radius of $x_{i-1}$ . If, however, we rotate the region around a line other than the y-axis, we have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we rotate the region around the line $x=-k$ , where $k$ is some positive constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is $x_{i}+k$ and the inner radius of the shell is $x_{i-1}+k$ .Substituting these terms into the expression for volume, we see that when a plane region is rotated around the line $x=-k$ , the volume of a shell is given by

V_shell = 2πf(xᵢ*)( (xᵢ+k)+(xᵢ₋₁+k)/2)((xᵢ+k)-(xᵢ₋₁+k)) = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2+k)Δx

As before, we notice that (xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2 is the midpoint of the interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] and can be approximated by $x_{i}^{n}$ . Then, the approximate volume of the shell is

Vshell ≈ 2π(xᵢ*+k)f(xᵢ*)Δx.

The remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that

V = ∫ₐᵇ (2π(x+k)f(x))dx

We could also rotate the reqion around other horizontal or vertical lines, such as a verticalline in the riqht half plane.In each case, the volume formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the $x$ -term in the integral must be replaced with an expression representinq the radius of a shell. To see how this works, consider the following example

## EXAMPLE 2.15

## A Region of Revolution Revolved around a Line

Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x$ and below by the $x$ -axis over the interval [1, 2]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the line $x=-1$

## $②$ Solution

First, graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fQLpfLpUSYci0KcgqMgS0cI8ZR4pzeRae.png)
Figure 2.32(a) Theregion R between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x$ -axis over the interval [1, 2] . (b) The solid of revolution

generated by revolving $R$ around the line $x=-1$ .

Note that the radius of a shell is given by $x+1$ .Then the volume of the solid is given by

V=∫₁²(2π(x+1)f(x))dx=∫₁²(2π(x+1)x)dx=2π∫₁²(x²+x)dx=2π[x³/3+x²/2]|₁²=23π/3 units³

2.15 Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ and below by the χ -axis over the interval [0, 1] . Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the line $x=-2$

For our final example in this section, let's look at the volume of a solid of revolution for which the region of revolution is bounded by the graphs of two functions.

# EXAMPLE 2.16

### A Region of Revolution Bounded by the Graphs of Two Functions Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x) = √x and below by the graph of the function

$g(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1,4] . Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving $R$ around the $y$ -axis.

First, graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/f8gDy78BQ4ElFmGp3p6ZcFE6txRbKLnbh.png)
Figure 2.33 (a) The region $R$ between the graph of $f(x)$ and the graph of $g(x)$ over the interval [1, 4] . (b) The solid of

revolution generated by revolving $R$ around the y-axis.

Note that the axis of revolution is the $y$ -axis, so the radius of a shell is given simply by $x.$ We don't need to make any adjustments to the x-term of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by $f(x)-g(x)$ , so in this case we need to adjust the $f(x)$ term of the integrand. Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫₁⁴(2πx(f(x)-g(x)))dx = ∫₁⁴(2πx(√x - 1/x))dx = 2π∫₁⁴(x³/² - 1)dx = 2π[2x⁵/²/5 - x]|₄¹ = 94π/5 units³

2.16 Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x$ and below by the graph of $g(x)=x^2$ over the interval [0, 1]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around the y-axis

## Which Method Should We Use?.

We have studied several methods for finding the volume of a solid of revolution,but how do we know which method tc use? It often comes down to a choice of which integral is easiest to evaluate. Fiqure 2.34 describes the different approaches for solids of revolution around the $x$ -axis. It's up to you to develop the analogous table for solids of revolution around the $y$ -axis.

Let's take a look at a couple of additional problems and decide on the best approach to take for solving them

# EXAMPLE 2.17

### Selecting the Best Method

For each of the following problems, select the best method to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by

revolving the given region around the $X$ -axis, and set up the integral to find the volume (do not evaluate the integral).

a.The region bounded by the graphs of $y=x$ $y=2-x$ ,and the $X$ -axis b.The region bounded by the graphs of $y=4x-x^{2}$ and the $x$ -axis.

## $②$ Solution

a.First, sketch the reqion and the solid of revolution as shown

![](./images/fwTuVTL2Htxgn4gkMqaSnvDazYptiUytC.png)
Figure 2.35 (a) The region $R$ bounded by two lines and the $X$ -axis. (b) The solid of revolution generated by revolvin

$R$ about the $x$ -axis

Looking at the region, if we want to integrate with respect to $X$ , we would have to break the integral into two pieces, because we have different functions bounding the region over [0,1] and [1,2]. In this case, using the disk method, we would have
V=∫₀¹(πx²)dx + ∫₁²(π(2-x)²)dx

If we used the shell method instead, we would use functions of $y$ to represent the curves, producing
V = ∫₀¹(2πy[(2-y)-y])dy = ∫₀¹(2πy[2-2y])dy

Neither of these integrals is particularly onerous, but since the shell method requires only one integral, and the integrand requires less simplification, we should probably go with the shell method in this case. b.First,sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown

![](./images/fvoMBybLrcd58r9Ggac068h40wf9rI3UW.png)
Figure 2.36 (a) Theregion $R$ between the curve and the $x$ -axis.(b) The solid of revolution generated byrevolving $R$

about the $x$ -axis

Looking at the region,it would be problematic to define a horizontal rectangle; the region is bounded on the left and right by the same function. Therefore, we can dismiss the method of shells. The solid has no cavity in the middle, so we can use the method of disks. Then
V=∫₀⁴π(4x-x²)²dx

![](./images/fFKqqP7GmDF0wGBMvVKI1gGFiuXLnUy3x.png)

Select the best method to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by revolving the given regior around the x-axis, and set up the inteqral to find the volume (do not evaluate the inteqral): the reqior bounded by the graphs of $y=2-x^{2}$ and $y=x^2$

![](./images/f5nm1agRZKT7s4AxYKFXcMPuCF56dCXN1.png)

# 2.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

## Learning Objectives

2.4.1Determine thelength of a curve, $y=f(x)$ ,between two points. 2.4.2 Determine the length of a curve, $x=g(y)$ ,between two points. 2.4.3Find the surface area of a solid of revolution

In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length.If a rocket is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.

We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of $X$ , then we examine the same process for curves defined as functions of $y$ (The process is identical, with the roles of $X$ and $y$ reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of this concept.

# Arc Length of the Curve $y=f(x)$

In previous applications of integration, we required the function $f(x)$ to be integrable, or at most continuous. However for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for $f(x)$ . Here, we require $f(x)$ to be differentiable, anc furthermore we require its derivative, f'(x) , to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)

Let $f(x)$ be a smooth function defined over $[a,b].$ We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point $(a,f(a))$ to the point $(b,f(b)).$ We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve.For $i=0$ ,1.,2...,, let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ . Then, for $i=1,2,...,n$ ,construct a line segment from the point (xᵢ₋₁, f(xᵢ₋₁)) to the point $(x_{i},f(x_{i}))$ .Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments,we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible.Fiqure 2.37depicts this construct for $n=5$

![](./images/fZOaZxVNA03L74ga8KPr1FMHPqbAMhIed.png)

Figure 2.37 We can approximate the length of a curve by adding line segments

To help us find the length of each line seqment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the chanqe in horizontal distance over each interval.Because we have used a reqular partition, the chanqe in horizontal distance over each interval is given by Δx .The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyᵢ = f(xᵢ) - f(xᵢ₋₁) to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], as shown in Figure 2.38 Note that some (or all) Δyᵢ may be negative

![](./images/fADPZA7AU9ZqI7h1GDmn6lONBO5H3Hdph.png)

Figure 2.38 A representative line segment approximates the curve over the interval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ]

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is √(Δx)² + (Δyᵢ)² We can also write this as Δx√(1 + (Δyᵢ/Δx)²)  Now, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] such that f'(xᵢ*) = (Δyᵢ)/(Δx) . Then the length of the line segment is given by Δx√(1+[f'(xᵢ*)]²). Adding up the lengths of al the line segments, we get

Arc Length≈∑_{i=1}^n√(1+[f'(xᵢ*)]²)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ ,we have

Arc Length = lim_(n→∞)∑_(i=1)ⁿ√(1+[f'(xᵢ*)²]) Δx = ∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²) dx.

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.4

### Arc Length for $y=f(x)$

Let $f(x)$ be a smooth function over the interval $[a,b].$ Then the arc length of the portion of the graph of $f(x)$ from the point $(a,f(a))$ to the point $( b$, $f( b) )$ is given by

Arc Length = ∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx

Note that we are integrating an expression involving f'(x) ,so we need to be sure f'(x) is integrable. This is why we require $f(x)$ to be smooth.The following example shows how to apply the theorem.

### EXAMPLE 2.18

## Calculating the Arc Length of a Function of x Let $f(x)=2x^{3/2}.$ Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [0, 1] . Round the answer to three

decimal places.

### $②$ Solution

We have f'(x)=3x¹/², so [f'(x)]²=9x Then, the arc length is

Arc Length =∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx =∫₀¹√(1+9x)dx.

Substitute $u=1+9x.$ Then, $du= 9$ $dx.$ When $x=0$ ,then $u=1$ , and when $x=1$ ,then $u=10$ .Thus

Arc Length = ∫₀¹√(1+9x) dx = (1/9)∫₀¹√(1+9x)9dx = (1/9)∫₁¹⁰√u du = (1/9)⋅(2/3)u³/²|₁¹⁰ = (2/27)[10√10 - 1] ≈ 2.268 units

2.18 Let $f( x) = ( 4/ 3)$ $x^{3/ 2}$ . Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [0, 1] . Round the answer to three decimal places.

Although it is nice to have a formula for calculating arc length, this particular theorem can generate expressions that are difficult to integrate. We study some techniques for integration in Introduction_to Techniques of Integration. In some cases,wemay have to use a computer or calculator to approximate thevalue of theintegral.

### EXAMPLE 2.19

Using a Computer or Calculator to Determine the Arc Length of a Function of x

Let $f(x)=x^{2}$ . Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [1, 3]

Solution

We have f'(x) = 2x ,so [f'(x)]² = 4x² . Then the arc length is given by

Arc Length=∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx=∫₁³√(1+4x²)dx.

Using a computer to approximate the value of this integral, we get

∫₁³√(1+4x²)dx≈8.26815

2.19 Let f(x) = sin x Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [0, π] . Use a computer or calculator to approximate the value of the integral.

# ArcLengthof the Curve $x=g(y)$

We have just seen how to approximate the length of a curve with line segments. If we want to find the arc length of the graph of a function of $y.$ we can repeat the same process, except we partition the $y$ -axis instead of the $x$ -axis.Figure 2.39 shows a representative line segment.

![](./images/f0kpeC3pGbfCdrfB5ZoU8Cs0PbghEF7bl.png)
Figure 2.39 A representative line segment over the interval $[y_{i-1},y_i]$

Then the length of the line segment is √(Δy)² + (Δxᵢ)², which can also be written as Δy√(1 + (Δxᵢ/Δy)²)  If we now follow the same development we did earlier, we get a formula for arc length of a function $x=g(y)$

### Theorem 2.5

## Arc Length for $x=g(y)$ Let $g(y)$ be a smooth function over a $y$ interval [c, d] . Then, the arc length of the graph of $g(y)$ from the point

$( g( d)$, $d)$ to the point (g(c), c) is given by

Arc Length = ∫cᵈ√(1 + [g'(y)]²)dy

### EXAMPLE 2.20

### Calculatinq the Arc Lenqth of a Function of y Let $g(y)=3y^{3}$ .Calculate the arc length of the graph of $g(y)$ over the interval [1,2]

We have g'(y)=9y², SO 
[g'(y)]² = 81y⁴ Then the arc length is

Arc Length = ∫₁²√(1+81y⁴)dy

Using a computer to approximate the value of this integral, we obtain

∫₁²√(1+81y⁴)dy≈21.0277

-1 2.20 Let $g(y)=1/y.$ Calculate the arc length of the graph of $g(y)$ over the interval [1, 4] . Use a computer on calculator to approximate the value of the integral

## Area of a Surface of Revolution

The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects such as cubes or bricks, the surface area of the object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Le $f(x)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval [a, b]. We wish to find the surface area of the surface of revolution created by revolving the graph of $y=f(x)$ around the $x$ -axis as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fyP2zfGYe7CLgTs6Us3QL4khoDg6pTFxT.png)
Figure 2.40 (a) A curve representing the function $f(x).$ (b) The surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of

$f(x)$ around the χ -axis

As we have done many times before, we are going to partition the interval $[a,b]$ and approximate the surface area by

calculating the surface area of simpler shapes. We start by using line segments to approximate the curve, as we did earlier in this section.For i=0,1,2,…,n let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ . Then, for i = 1, 2, ..., n ,construct a line segment from the point (xᵢ₋₁, f(xᵢ₋₁)) to the point $(x_{i},f(x_{i})).$ Now, revolve these line segments around the $x$ -axis to generate an approximation of the surface of revolution as shown in the following figure

![](./images/f4hFrLpRhBiVGns21aMU2otQGZw29UGwg.png)

Figure 2.41 (a) Approximating $f(x)$ with line segments. (b) The surface of revolution formed by revolving the line seqments around the $x$ -axis

Notice that when each line seqment is revolved around the axis,it produces a band. These bands are actually pieces of cones (think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off).A piece of a cone like this is called a frustum of a cone

To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area, $S$ ,of the frustum (the area of just the slanted outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or bottom faces). Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the radi of the wide end and the narrow end of the frustum, respectively,and let $I$ be the slant height of the frustum as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fVg0Qg8kxAxpzEdRsriGoW5uv1smdRovA.png)

Figure 2.42 A frustum of a cone can approximate a small part of surface area.

We know the lateral surface area of a cone is given by

Lateral Surface Area πrs

where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cone and $s$ is the slant height (see the following figure)

![](./images/fu1ARioAuAFkcX3qlw8PFnMxnZk2ao4HI.png)

Figure 2.43 The lateral surface area of the cone is given by πrs

Since a frustum canbe thought of as a pieceof a cone,thelateral surface area of thefrustum is given by thelateral surface area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone (the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the following figure).

![](./images/fmwgUZTg6Gsv0SXm2gpYUTfVAAQPy4Yl3.png)
Figure 2.44 Calculating the lateral surface area of a frustum of a cone.

The cross-sections of the small cone and the large cone are similar triangles, so we see that

r₂/r₁ = (s-l)/s

Solving for s, we get

r₂/r₁ = (s-l)/s; r₂s = r₁(s-l); r₂s = r₁s - r₁l; r₁l = r₁s - r₂s; r₁l = (r₁-r₂)s; r₁l/(r₁-r₂) = s.

Then the lateral surface area (SA) of the frustum is

S = (Lateral SA of large cone)-(Lateral SA of sm) = πr₁s - πr₂(s-l) = πr₁(r₁l/(r₁-r₂)) - πr₂(r₁l/(r₁-r₂)-l) = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + πr₂l = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + (πr₂l(r₁-r₂))/(r₁-r₂) = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₂²l)/(r₁-r₂) = (π(r₁²-r₂²)l)/(r₁-r₂) = (π(r₁-r₂)(r₁+r₂)l)/(r₁-r₂) = π(r₁+r₂)l.

Let's now use this formula to calculate the surface area of each of the bands formed by revolving the line segments around the $x$ -axis. A representative band is shown in the following figure

![](./images/fuNWi8AbZRWKbo5K7eyYyp06Ku94ektza.png)
Figure 2.45 A representative band used for determining surface area

Note that the slant height of this frustum is just the length of the line segment used to generate it. So, applying the surface area formula.we have

S=π(r₁+r₂)l=π(f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ))√(Δx²+(Δyᵢ)²)=π(f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ))Δx√(1+(Δyᵢ/Δx)²) 

Now, as we did in the development of the arc length formula, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to select xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] such that f'(xᵢ*) = (Δyᵢ)/Δx This gives us

S = π(f(xᵢ₋₁) + f(xᵢ))Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²)

Furthermore, since $f(x)$ is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem,there is a point xᵢ**∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] such tha f(xᵢ**)=(1/2)[f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ)], so we get

S=2πf(xᵢ*)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²)

Then the approximate surface area of the whole surface of revolution is given by

Surface Area≈∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πf(xᵢ**)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²)

This almost looks like a Riemann sum, except we have functions evaluated at two different points, $x_i^{*}$ and $x_{i}^{k**}$, overthe interval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] Although we do not examine the details here, it turns out that because $f(x)$ is smooth,if we let n→∞ , the limit works the same as a Riemann sum even with the two different evaluation points. This makes sense intuitively. Both $x_{i}^{*}$ and $x_{i}^{-4}$ are in the interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ], so it makes sense that as n→∞ ,both $x_{i}^{*}$ and $x_i^{q+q}$ approach x

Those of you who are interested in the details should consult an advanced calculus text.

Taking the limit as n→∞ , we get

Surface Area = limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πf(xᵢ**)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²) = ∫ₐᵇ(2πf(x)√(1+(f'(x))²))dx

As with arc length, we can conduct a similar development for functions of $y$ to get a formula for the surface area of surfaces of revolution about the $y$ -axis.These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.6

### Surface Area of a Surface of Reyolutior

Let $f(x)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval $[a,b].$ Then, the surface area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of $f(x)$ around the x-axis is given by

Surface Area = ∫ₐᵇ (2πf(x)√(1 + (f'(x))²))dx

Similarly, let $g(y)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval $[c,d].$ Then, the surface area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of $g(y)$ around the y-axis is given by

Surface Area=∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>(2πg(y)√(1+(g'(y))²))dy.

Figure 2.46 (a) The graph of $f(x).$ (b) The surface of revolution

We have f(x) = √x Then, f'(x)=1/(2√x) and (f'(x))² = 1/(4x) . Then,

Surface Area=∫ₐᵇ(2πf(x)√(1+(f'(x))²))dx=∫₁⁴(2π√x√(1+1/(4x)))dx=∫₁⁴(2π√(x+1/4))dx

Let $u=x+1/4$ .Then, $du=dx.$ When $x=1,u=5/4$ , and when x = 4 $x=4$ $x=4,u=17/4$ This gives us
∫₁⁴(2π√(x+¼))dx =∫₅/₄¹⁷/₄2π√u du =2π[⅔u³/²]|₅/₄¹⁷/₄=(π/6)[17√17-5√5]≈30.846

![](./images/fC7WGfdWhBgrnSoTlZH1QPRm4Er7CgiiF.png)

Notice that we are revolving the curve around the y-axis, and the interval is in terms of $y$ so we want to rewrite the function as a function of $y.$ We get x=g(y)=(1/3)y³.  The graph of $g(y)$ and the surface of rotation are shown in the following figure.

Figure 2.47 (a) The graph of $g(y).$ (b) The surface of revolution

We have $g( y) = ( 1/ 3)$ $y^{3}$, 5o g'(y) = y² and (g'(y))²=y⁴ Then

Surface Area = ∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>(2πg(y)√(1+(g'(y))²))dy = ∫₀²(2π(⅓y³)√(1+y⁴))dy = (2π/3)∫₀²(y³√(1+y⁴))dy

Let $u=y^{4}+1.$ Then $du=4y^{3}dy$ .When y =0 $y=0$ $y=0,u=1$ $u=1$ u = 1 , and when $y=2$ y=2 $y=2,u=17$ Then
(2π/3)∫₀² (y³√(1+y⁴))dy = (2π/3)∫₁¹⁷ (1/4)√u du = (π/6)[(2/3)u³/²]|₁¹⁷ = (π/9)[(17)³/²-1] ≈ 24.118

# 2.5 Physical Applications

## Learning Objectives 2.5.1Determine the mass of a one-dimensional object from its linear density function

2.5.2 Determine the mass of a two-dimensional circular object from its radial density function. 2.5.3 Calculate the work done by a variable force acting along a line 2.5.4Calculate the work done inpumping a liquid from one height to another 2.5.5 Find the hydrostatic force against a submerged vertical plate.

In this section, we examine some physical applications of integration. Let's begin with a look at calculating mass from a density function. We then turn our attention to work, and close the section with a study of hydrostatic force

## Mass and Density

We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we consider a thin rod or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the $x$ -axis,with theleft end of the rod at $x=a$ and the right end of the rod at $x=b$ (Figure 2.48). Note that although we depict the rod with some thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes we assume the rod is thin enough tobe treated as a one-dimensional object

![](./images/f1GAzodWc8aGFUkeUfUcSULemglTvVfF1.png)

Figure 2.48We cancalculate the massof a thin rod oriented along the $x$ -axis by integrating its density function

If the rod has constant density ρ , given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is just the product of the density and the length of the rod: $( b- a)$ ρ If the density of the rod is not constant, however, the problem becomes a little more challenging. When the density of the rod varies from point to point, we use a linear density function, ρ(x) ,to denote the density of the rod at any point, $X$ . Let ρ(x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for $i=0,1,2,...,n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$ ,and for $i=1,2,...,n$ choose an arbitrary point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] Fiqure 2.49 shows a representative segment of the rod

![](./images/fzz5HG7KOARgbaTMgGREMkoLCKxhglG7B.png)
Figure 2.49 A representative segment of the rod

The mass $m_i$ of the segment of the rod from $x_{i-1}$ to $x_i$ is approximated by

mᵢ ≈ ρ(xᵢ*) (xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = ρ(xᵢ*)Δx

Adding the masses of all the seqments qives us an approximation for the mass of the entire rod

m = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>m<sub>i</sub> ≈ ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>ρ(x<sub>i</sub>*)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ ,we get an expression for the exact mass of the rod:

m = limₙ→∞ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ ρ(xᵢ*)Δx = ∫ₐᵇ ρ(x)dx.

We state this result in the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.7

Mass-Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object

Given a thin rod oriented along the $x$ -axis over the interval $[a,b]$ ,let ρ(x) denote a linear density function giving the density of the rod at a point $x$ in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by

m = ∫_a^bρ(x)dx.

We apply this theorem in the next example.

# EXAMPLE 2.23

### Calculating Mass from Linear Density

Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [π/2, π] If the density of the rod is given by ρ(x)=sin x what is the mass of the rod?

## $②$ Solution

Applying Equation 2.10 directly, we have

m=∫ₐᵇρ(x)dx=∫π/₂πsin x dx=-cos x|π/₂π=1.

√1 2.23 Consider a thin rod oriented on the X-axis over the interval [1, 3] . If the density of the rod is given by ρ(x) = 2x²+3 what is the mass of the rod?

We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r. As with the rod we looked at in the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a two dimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further assume the density varies only along the disk's radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the $xy$ -plane,with the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of $x$ , denoted ρ(x) . We assume ρ(x) is integrable.Because density is a function of $x$ ,we partition the interval from $[0,r]$ along the $X$ -axis. For i=0,1,2,…,n let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[0,r]$ , and for $i=1,2,...,n$ , choose an arbitrary point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a representative washer are depicted in the following figure.

![](./images/fabMZKzA3MIP81bNWdHrHmPRknPHTixWD.png)
Figure 2.50 (a) A thin disk in the xy-plane. (b) A representative washer.

We now approximate the density and area of the washer to calculate an approximate mass, $m_i$ . Note that the area of the washer is given by

A = π(xᵢ)² - π(xᵢ₋₁)² = π[xᵢ² - xᵢ₋₁²] = π(xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = π(xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)Δx

You may recall that we had an expression similar to this when we were computing volumes by shells. As we did there, we use xᵢ* ≈ (xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2 to approximate the average radius of the washer. We obtain

Aᵢ=π(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁ )Δx≈2πxᵢ*Δx

Using ρ(xᵢ*) to approximate the density of the washer, we approximate the mass of the washer by

mᵢ≈2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx

Adding up the masses of the washers, we see the mass 177 of the entire disk is approximated by

m = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢ ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx

We again recognize this as a Riemann sum, and take the limit as n→∞ . This gives us

m=limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx=∫₀ʳ2πxρ(x)dx

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.8

### Mass-Density Formula of a Circular Object

Let ρ(x) be an integrable function representing the radial density of a disk of radius r. Then the mass of the disk is given by

m = ∫₀ʳ 2πxρ(x)dx

## EXAMPLE 2.24

### Calculating Mass from Radial Density

Let ρ(x)=√x represent the radial density of a disk. Calculate the mass of a disk of radius 4.

Solution

Applying the formula, we find

m = ∫₀ʳ 2πxρ(x)dx = ∫₀⁴ 2πx√x dx = 2π∫₀⁴ x³/² dx = (4π/5)[32] = 128π/5.

![](./images/fvPyzGeMQesGzWHBDUhgmDekpK2x7lMMn.png)

2.24 Let ρ(x)=3x+2 represent the radial density of a disk. Calculate the mass of a disk of radius 2.

# Work Done by a Force

We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a push or pull on an object. When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of as the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be expressed as the product of force and distance.

In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds. In the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of lᵐ/sec² Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule Both are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared (kg· m²/s²

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.

Suppose we have a variable force $F(x)$ that moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point $b$ To calculate the work done, we partition the interval [a, $b]$ and estimate the work done over each subinterval.So,for $i=0,1,2,...,n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$ ,and for i = 1, 2, ..., n ,choose an arbitrary point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] To calculate the work done to move an object from point xᵢ₋₁ to point $X_{i}$ ,we assume the force is roughly constant over the interval, and use $F(x_{i}^{*})$ to approximate the force. The work done over the interval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ then, is given by

Wᵢ≈F(xᵢ*)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)=F(xᵢ*)Δx

Therefore, the work done over the interval $[a,b]$ is approximately


W = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿWᵢ ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿF(xᵢ*)Δx

Taking the limit of this expression as n→∞ gives us the exact value for work:

W = limₙ→∞Σᵢ₌₁ⁿF(xᵢ*)Δx = ∫ₐᵇF(x)dx

Thus, we can define work as follows.

### Definition

If a variable force $F(x)$ moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point b, then the work done on the object is

W=∫ₐᵇF(x)dx.

Note that if $F$ is constant, the integral evaluates to F⋅(b-a) = F⋅d , which is the formula we stated at the beginning of

### this section

Now let's look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a block attached to a horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and compresses. Although in the real world we would have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction here and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the system is said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium position the block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that $x=0$ corresponds to the equilibrium position (see the following figure)

![](./images/fZ0Ns31pvPmZhitn8tqCXGeuxNOvytFGM.png)
Figure 2.51A block attached to a horizontal spring at equilibrium, compressed, and elongated

According to Hooke's law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by $F(x)=kx$ for some constant $k$ . The value of $k$ depends on the physical characteristics of the spring.The constant $k$ is called the spring constant and is always positive. We can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or elongate a spring,as shown in the following example

### EXAMPLE 2.25

## The Work Required to Stretch or Compress a Spring

Suppose it takes a force of $10N$ (in the negative direction) to compress a spring $0.2m$ from the equilibrium position How much work is done to stretch the spring $0.5m$ from the equilibrium position

## $②$ Solution

First find the spring constant, $k.$ When $x=-0.2$ , we know $F(x)=-10$ SO

F(x)=kx, -10=k(-0.2), k=50

and $F(x)=50x$ . Then, to calculate work, we integrate the force function, obtaining

W = ∫ₐᵇF(x)dx = ∫₀⁰·⁵ 50x dx = 25x²|₀⁰·⁵ = 6.25

The work done to stretch the spring is 6.25

# Work Done in Pumping

Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a little more complicated than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape and size of the tank. In addition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to move a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the water from the top of the tank.

We examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank,then look at a couple of examples using tanks of different shapes. Assume a cylindrical tank of radius $4m$ and height $10m$ is filled to a depth of $8m$ How much work does it take to pump all the water over the top edge of the tank?

The first thing we need to do is define a frame of reference. We let $x$ represent thevertical distance below the top of the tank. That is, we orient the $x$ -axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive (see the following figure).

![](./images/fHPI82cOTEDovgrfvgOat4BIGBvXqQOIC.png)
Figure 2.52 How much work is needed to empty a tank partially filled with water?

Using this coordinate system, the water extends from $x=2$ to $x=10$ Therefore, we partition the interval [2, 10] anc look at the work required to lift each individual “layer"of water.So,for i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xᵢ} be a regular partitior of the interval [2, 10] , and for i = 1, 2, ..., n, choose an arbitrary point xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] Figure 2.53 shows a representative layer.

![](./images/fzDVKLqnyzr2kxaMGFH5PFRmYDxGTdkUo.png)
Figure 2.53 A representative layer of water

In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to overcome gravity so it is equal to the weight of the water.Given that the weight-density of water is $9800N/m^{3}$ or 62.4 lb/ft, calculating the volume of each layer gives us the weight. In this case, we have

V=π(4)²Δx=16πΔx

Then, the force needed to lift each layer is

F = 9800·16πΔx = 156800πΔx

Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank.We look at a noncylindrical tank in the next example

We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate systems, we can use $x_i^*$ as an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to lift the ith layer of water $W_{i}$ is approximately

Wᵢ≈156,800πxᵢ*Δx.

Adding the work for each layer, we see the approximate work to empty the tank is given by

W=∑_(i=1)^n Wᵢ≈∑_(i=1)^n 156,800πxᵢ*Δx.

This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit as n→∞ ,weget

W = lim_{n→∞}∑_{i=1}^n 156800πxᵢ*Δx = 156800π∫₂¹⁰ x dx = 156800π[x²/2]|₂¹⁰ = 7526400π ≈ 23644883

The work required to empty the tank is approximately 23,650,000 j.

For pumping problems,the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container.The following problem solving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Solving Pumping Problem

1.Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference 2.Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water 3.Multiply the volume by the weight-density of water to get the force 4.Calculate thedistance the layer of water must be lifted 5.Multiply the force and distance to get an estimate of the work needed to lift the layer of water 6.Sum the work required to lift all the layers. This expression is an estimate of the work required to pump out the desired amount of water,and itis in the form ofaRiemann sum 7.Take the limit as n→∞ and evaluate the resulting integral to get the exact work required to pump out the desired amount of water

We now apply this problem-solving strategy in an example with a noncylindrical tank

## EXAMPLE 2.26

## A Pumping Problem with a Noncylindrical Tank

Assume a tank in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 12 ft and base radius 4 ft. The tank is full to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until the height of the water remaining in the tank is 4 ft. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

## $②$ Solution

The tank is depicted in Eiqure 2.54. As we did in the example with the cylindrical tank, we orient the $x$ -axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive (step 1)

![](./images/fMOavFScGMh3c06LGgRz1PRK73cY94ms3.png)
Figure 2.54Awater tank in theshape of an invertedcone

The tank starts out full and ends with 4 ft of water left, so, based on our chosen frame of reference, we need to partition the interval [0, 8] . Then, for $i=0$ i=0 i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval [0,8], and for i = 1, 2, ..., n choose an arbitrary pointe xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] . We can approximate the volume of a layer by using a disk, then use similar triangles to find the radius of the disk (see the following figure)

![](./images/f3vwD9THYHlsk4bfLNeiiFmotLk9G2G6e.png)
Figure 2.55 Using similar triangles to express the radius of a disk of water

From properties of similar triangles,we have

rᵢ/(12-xᵢ*) = 4/12 = 1/3; 3rᵢ = 12-xᵢ*; rᵢ = (12-xᵢ*)/3 = 4 - xᵢ*/3

Then the volume ofthe disk is

Vᵢ=π(4-xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 2).

The weight-density of water is 62.4 Ib/ft², so the force needed to lift each layer is approximately

Fᵢ≈62.4π(4-xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 3)

Based on the diagram, the distance the water must be lifted is approximately $x_{i}^{*}$ feet (step 4), so the approximate work needed to lift the layer is

Wᵢ ≈ 62.4πxᵢ*(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 5)

Summing the work required to lift all the layers, we get an approximate value of the total work
W = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿWᵢ ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ62.4πxᵢ*(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 6)

Taking the limit as n→∞ , we obtain

![](./images/fZGnGgTwwXCIXKGdo9Y1oxN8DscDzGVlE.png)

It takes approximately 33,450 ft-lb of work to empty the tank to the desired level.

2.26 A tank is in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 10 ft and base radius 6 ft. The tank is filled to a depth of 8 ft to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until 3 ft of water remain in the tank. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

# Hydrostatic Force and Pressure

In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the English system, force is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.

Let's begin with the simple case of a plate of area $A$ submerged horizontally in water at a depth 5 (Figure 2.56).Then, the force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by F=ρAs ,where ρ is the weight density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a submerged object-we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p = F/A = ρs

![](./images/f508UnGSwGunosIuLcUchmpxgrcw20YGo.png)

Figure 2.56 A plate submerged horizontally in water

By Pascal's principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is submerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal's principle to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F=ρAs directly, because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we form a partition, a Riemann sum, and,ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.

Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is oriented vertically, with the downward direction being positive, and point $x=0$ corresponding to a logical reference point. Let $s(x)$ denote the depth at point $X$ Note we often let $x=0$ correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply given by $s(x)=x$ .However, in some cases we may want to select a different reference point for $x=0$ ,sowe proceed with the development in the more general case.Last, let $u(x)$ denote the width of the plate at thepoint $X$

Assume the top edge of the plate is at point $x=a$ and the bottom edge of the plate is at point $x=b$ . Then, for i=0,1,2,…,n let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[ a, b]$ , and for i = 1, 2, ..., n choose an arbitrary point xᵢ* ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] The partition divides the plate into several thin, rectangular strips (see the following figure)

![](./images/fDeZxUWlmPrbUIXIhyeYb8TYC2zuMKfEg.png)
Figure 2.57 A thin plate submerged vertically in water.

Let's now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it is at a constant depth, $s(x_i^{*}.$ ).We then have

Fᵢ = ρAs = ρ[v(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*) 

Adding the forces, we get an estimate for the force on the plate

F≈∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿFᵢ=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿρ[w(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*)

This is a Riemann sum, so takinq the limit qives us the exact force.We obtain

F = limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ ρ[w(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*) = ∫ₐᵇ ρw(x)s(x)dx

Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-solving strategy

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Finding Hydrostatic Force

1.Sketch a picture and select an appropriate frame of reference.(Note that if we select a frame of reference other than the one used earlier we may have to adjust Equation 2.13 accordingly. 2.Determine the depth and width functions, $s(x)$ and $uv(x)$ 3.Determine the weight-density of whatever liquid with which you are working. The weight-density of water is 62.4 Ib/ft²3, or $9800N/m^{3}$ 4.Use the equation to calculate the total force.

Select a frame of reference with the $x$ -axis oriented vertically and the downward direction being positive. Select the top of the trough as the point corresponding to $x=0$ (step 1). The depth function, then, is $s(x)=x$ . Using similar triangles,. we see that $w( x) = 8- ( 8/ 3)$ $x$ (step 2). Now, the weight density of water is 62.4 Ib/ft² (step 3), so applying Equation 2.13,

### we obtain

F=∫ₐᵇρw(x)s(x)dx =∫₀³62.4(8-(8/3)x)x dx=62.4∫₀³(8x-(8/3)x²)dx =62.4[4x²-(8/9)x³]|₀³=748.8

The water exerts a force of 748.8 Ib on the end of the trough (step 4).

### EXAMPLE 2.28

### Chapter Opener: Finding Hydrostatic Force

We now return our attention to the Hoover Dam,mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The actual dam is arched rather than flat, but we are going to make some simplifying assumptions to help us with the calculations. Assume the face of the Hoover Dam is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid with lower base 750 ft, upper base 1250 ft, and height 750 ft (see the following figure).

![](./images/f2viRtzgCL6HtPro65mkzBoAmN3yS5gTe.png)
When the reservoir is full, Lake Mead’s maximum depth is about 530 ft, and the surface of the lake is about 10 ft below

the top of the dam (see the following figure).

![](./images/fR7OyQmkErGF49tqduRdXx6Lywc5zwgbv.png)
Figure 2.59 A simplified model of the Hoover Dam with assumed dimensions

a.Find the force on the face of the dam when the reservoir is full b.The southwest United States has been experiencing a drought, and the surface of Lake Mead is about 125 ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full.what is the force on the face of the dam under these circumstances?

## $①$ Solution

a.We begin by establishing a frame of reference. As usual, we choose to orient the $x$ -axis vertically, with the downward direction being positive.This time,however, we are going to let $x=0$ represent the top of the dam rather than the surface of the water. When the reservoir is full, the surface of the water is 10 ft below the top of the dam, so $s(x)=x-10$ (see the following figure)

![](./images/f6aQx1rliKhxrMZD5b2F1slpTYbmZLK3h.png)
Figure 2.60 We first choose a frame of reference

To find the width function, we again turn to similar triangles as shown in the figure below.
![](./images/fCYCxG0GfAVU6ycXdaXu9BrHMDP9rMgOZ.png)

Figure 2.61 We use similar triangles to determine a function for the width of the dam.(a) Assumed dimensions of

the dam; (b) highlighting the similar triangles

From the figure, we see that $w(x)=750+2r$ . Using properties of similar triangles, we get $r= 250- ( 1/ 3)$ $x.$ Thus
w(x) = 1250 - (2/3)x (step 2)

Using a weight-density of 62.4 Ib/ft² (step 3) and applying Equation 2.13, we get
V = ∫ₐᵇ ρw(x)s(x)dx = ∫₁₀⁵⁴⁰ 62.4(1250 - (2/3)x)(x - 10) dx = 62.4∫₁₀⁵⁴⁰ -(2/3)[x² - 1885x + 18750] dx = -(62.4)(2/3)[x³/3 - (1885x²)/2 + 18750x]|₁₀⁵⁴⁰ ≈ 8,832,245,000 lb = 4,416,122.5 t

Note the change frompounds to tons (2000 Ib =1 ton) (step 4).

b.Notice that the drought changes our depth function, $s(x)$ , and our limits of integration. We have $s(x)=x-135$ The lower limit of integration is 135. The upper limit remains 540. Evaluating the integral, we get

F =∫ₐᵇρw(x)s(x)dx =∫₁₃₅⁵⁴⁰62.4(1250−⅔x)(x−135)dx =−62.4(⅔)∫₁₃₅⁵⁴⁰(x−1875)(x−135)dx=−62.4(⅔)∫₁₃₅⁵⁴⁰(x²−2010x+253125)dx =−62.4(⅔)[x³/3−1005x²+253125x]|₁₃₅⁵⁴⁰≈5,015,230,000 lb=2,507,615 t.

2.28 When the reservoir is at its average level, the surface of the water is about 50 ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full. What is the force on the face of the dam under these circumstances?

# 2.6 Moments and Centers of Mass

### Learning Objectives

2.6.1Find the center of mass of objects distributed along a line. 2.6.2Locate the center of mass of a thin plate 2.6.3Usesymmetry to help locate the centroid of a thin plate. 2.6.4 Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume

In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and moments. The basic idea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the ends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate (without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers spin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.) Mathematically,that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate

In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by applying the theorem of Pappus

## Center of Mass and Moments.

Let's begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 2.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_2$ at distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.62(b)

![](./images/fZR8LL9OdOpxZnYOLC4XoZpGOXeebQzIF.png)

Figure 2.62 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are placed on the rod.

The most common real-life example of a svstem like this is a plavaround seesaw, or teeter-totter with children of different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if $m_{1}d_{1}=m_{2}d_{2}$

In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system b moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_2$ , located on a number line at points $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively (Eiqure 2.63). The center of mass, x̄ is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system balance.

![](./images/f6XbZFVP6qSMAmXMATOfIhCedelQDpFxr.png)

Figure 2.63 The center of mass $X$ is the balance point of the system

Thus. we have

m₁(|x̄-x₁|)=m₂|x₂-x̄|; m₁(x̄-x₁)=m₂(x₂-x̄); m₁x̄-m₁x₁=m₂x₂-m₂x̄; x̄(m₁+m₂)=m₁x₁+m₂x₂; x̄=(m₁x₁+m₂x₂)/(m₁+m₂)

The expression in the numerator, $m_1x_1+m_2x_2$ , is called the first moment of the system with respect to the origin. If the context is clear,we often drop the word first and just refer to this expression as the moment of the system.The expression in the denominator, $m_{1}+m_{2}$ , is the total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the point at which the total massof the system could be concentrated without changing the moment

This idea is not limited just to two point masses. In general, if n masses, $m_{1}$ m1 m₁, m₂, …, mₙ , are placed on a number line a points x₁, x₂, …, xₙ, respectively,then the center of mass of the system is given by

![](./images/fCqRV7LNyx46W7XehTflLmAtGw7EfXlI8.png)

### Theorem 2.9

Center of Mass of Objects on a Line

![](./images/fvGGqBYllYwZS0gUzhoqbqv3hnYpuEMgo.png)

Let m₁, m₂, …, mₙ be point masses placed on a number line at points x₁, x₂, …, xₙ , respectively, a denote the total mass of the system.Then,themoment of thesystem withrespect to the oriqin is qiven by

M = Σ_(i=1)^n mᵢxᵢ

and the center of mass of the system is given by

x̄ = M/m

We apply this theorem in the following example.

### EXAMPLE 2.29

### Finding the Center of Mass of Objects along a Line Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows

m₁ = 30 kg, placed at x₁ = -2 m  m₂ = 5 kg, placed at x₂ = 3 m  m₃ = 10 kg, placed at x₃ = 6 m  m₄ = 15 kg, placed at x₄ = -3 m.

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.

![](./images/fweP1GZeWfgEXWWyGG8kKZFH9aGU2bIo3.png)

First, we need to calculate the moment of the system:

M = Σᵢ₌₁⁴ mᵢxᵢ = -60 + 15 + 60 - 45 = -30

Now. to find the center of mass. we need the total mass of the svstem

m=∑ᵢ₌₁⁴mᵢ=30+5+10+15=60 kg

Then we have

x̄=M/m=-30/60=-1/2

The center of mass is located $1/2m$ to theleft of the origin

![](./images/fcA93GGPLTID1sYmQSaTCmuQXFRfVRFA3.png)

2.29 Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:

m₁=12 kg, placed at x₁=-4 m; m₂=12 kg, placed at x₂=4 m; m₃=30 kg, placed at x₃=2 m; m₄=6 kg, placed at x₄=-6 m.
Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system

We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane. Let $m_{1}$ be a point mass located at point $(x_{1},y_{1})$ in the plane. Then the moment $M_{x}$ of the mass with respect to the $x.$ axis is given by $M_{X}=m_{1}y_{1}$ . Similarly, the moment $M_{y}$ with respect to the y-axis is given by $M_{y}=m_{1}x_{1}$ . Notice that the x-coordinate of the point is used to calculate the moment with respect to the y-axis, and vice versa. The reason is that the $x$ coordinate

gives the distance from the point mass to the y-axis, and the y-coordinate gives the distance to the x-axis (see the following figure).

![](./images/fSuQ5NMePKB3TSLPGF0qKoIRpW7fw1qhu.png)

Figure 2.64 Point mass $m_{1}$ is located at point $(x_1,y_1)$ in the plane

If we have several point masses in the xy-plane, we can use the moments with respect to the $x-$ and y-axes to calculate the $x-$ and y-coordinates of the center of mass of the system

### Theorem 2.10

### Center of Mass of Objects in a Plane Let m₁, m₂, …, mₙ be point masses located in the xy-plane at points $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n)$, respectively, and

et m = m; denotethe total mass of the system. Then the moments $M_x$ and $M_y$ of the system with respect to the $x-$ and y-axes, respectively, are given by

Mₓ=∑_(i=1)^nmᵢyᵢ and Mᵧ=∑_(i=1)^nmᵢxᵢ

Also, the coordinates of the center of mass (x̄,ȳ) of the system are

x̄=Mᵧ/m and ȳ=Mₓ/m.

The next example demonstrates how to apply this theorem.

# EXAMPLE 2.30

### Finding theCenter of Mass of objectsinaPlane

Suppose three point masses are placed in the xy-plane as follows (assume coordinates are given in meters):

m₁ = 2 kg, placed at (-1,3); m₂ = 6 kg, placed at (1,1); m₃ = 4 kg, placed at (2,-2)

Find the center of massof the system

## $①$ Solution

First we calculate the total mass of the system:

m=∑ᵢ₌₁³mᵢ=2+6+4=12 kg.

Next we find the moments with respect to the $x.$ and yaxes:

Mᵧ=∑ᵢ₌₁³mᵢxᵢ=-2+6+8=12, Mₓ=∑ᵢ₌₁³mᵢyᵢ=6+6-8=4

Then we have

x̄ = My/m = 12/12 = 1 and ȳ = Mx/m = 4/12 = 1/3

The center of mass of the system is (1,1/3) ,in meters.

![](./images/frOxf0dePtUBmDBVfMXv7YGFOkYD209Ui.png)

2.30 Suppose three point masses are placed on a number line as follows (assume coordinates are given in meters):

m = 5 kg, placed at (—2, —3) m2 = 3 kg, placed at (2, 3), m = 2 kg, placed at (3, 2)

Find the center of mass of the system

## Center of Mass of Thin Plates

So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having the mass of a system concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is two dimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this section,we also assume the density of the lamina is constant

Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only on the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane.As with systems of point masses we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the $x-$ and y-axes.

We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the lamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle. Based on this understanding, it is clear that the center of mass of a rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect which isa result of the symmetryprinciple,and it isstated herewithout proof

### Theorem 2.11

### The Symmetry Principle

If a region Ris symmetric about a line $I$, then the centroid of R lies on I

Let's turn to more general laminas. Suppose we have a lamina bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ , below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fWMGnyFx5RY4YKK7bwLR9x0UhxuN4DeHz.png)

Figure 2.65 A region in the plane representing a lamina

As with svstems of point masses. to find the center of mass of the lamina. we need to find the total mass of the lamina as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the $x.$ and y-axes. As we have done many times before, we approximate these quantities by partitioning the interval $[a,b]$ and constructing rectangles.

For i=0,1,2,…,n let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ . Recall that we can choose any point within the interval [xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] as our xᵢ²π . In this case, we want $x_i^{*}$ to be the x-coordinate of the centroid of our rectangles.Thus, for i = 1, 2, ..., n we select xᵢ*∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] such that $x_i^{2k}$ is the midpoint of the interval. That is, xᵢ* = (xᵢ₋₁ + xᵢ)/2 Now,for i = 1, 2, ..., n construct arectangle of height f(xᵢ*) on [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] The center of mass of this rectangle is (xᵢ*, (f(xᵢ*))/2) as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fETm3HLTq2gdUt7CHO6LPwLY8boeIV59C.png)

Figure 2.66 A representative rectangle of the lamina

Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let ρ represent the density of the lamina (note that ρ is a constant) In this case, ρ is expressed in terms of mass per unit area. Thus, to find the total mass of the rectangle, we multiply the area of the rectangle by ρ . Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by ρf(xᵢ*)Δx

To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get

m ≈ ∑_(i=1)^n ρf(xᵢ*)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ qives the exact mass of the lamina

m=lim_(n→∞)∑_(i=1)^n ρf(xᵢ*)Δx=ρ∫_[a]^[b]f(x)dx

Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis.Returning to the representative rectangle,recall its center of mass is (xᵢ*,f(xᵢ*)/2). Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of mass doesnot change the moment.Thus,the moment of therectangle withrespect to thex-axis isqivenby the mass of the rectangle, ρf(xᵢ*)Δx , multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis: (f(xᵢ*))/2 . Therefore, the moment with respect tothex-axis of the rectangle is ρ(([f(xᵢ^φ)]²/2)Δx. Adding the momentsof the rectangles and taking the limit of the resulting Riemann sum,we see that the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis is

Mₓ = limₙ→∞ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ ρ[f(xᵢ*)]²/2 Δx = ρ∫ₐᵇ [f(x)]²/2 dx.

We derive the moment with respect to the y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center of mass of the

rectangle to they-axis is $x_{i}^{* }$ . Then the moment of the lamina with respect to the y-axis is given by

Mᵧ = lim_{n→∞}∑_{i=1}^n ρxᵢ*f(xᵢ*)Δx = ρ∫_{a}^b xf(x) dx

We find the coordinates of the center of mass by dividing the moments by the total mass to give x̄=Mᵧ/m and $y=M_{x}/m$ If we look closely at the expressions for $M_{x},M_{y}$ , and $m$ ,we notice that the constant ρ cancels out when X̄ and ȳ are calculated

We summarize these findings in the following theorem

### Theorem 2.12

### Center of Mass of a Thin Plate in the xy-Plane

Let R denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ ,below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ , respectively. Let ρ denote the density of the associated lamina.Then we can make the following statements

i.The mass of the lamina is

m = ρ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx

ii.The moments $M_{x}$ and $M_{y}$ of the lamina with respect to the $x-$ and y-axes, respectively, are
Mₓ=ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²/2dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x)dx.

ili.The coordinates of the center of mass $(x,y)$ are

x̄=Mᵧ/m and ȳ=Mₓ/m

In the next example.we use this theorem to find the center of mass of a lamina

## EXAMPLE 2.31

### Finding the Center of Mass of a Lamina Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x) = √x and below by the Xx-axis over the interval

[0,4].Find the centroid of the region.

![](./images/fEp5zSmM3G7RKBMK8dOXO4TuuSgnxrWNm.png)

The region is depicted in the following figure.

![](./images/fpSY4Huz9XZk0zeRTR2aGuG7W2oi8tQ6D.png)

Figure 2.67 Finding the center of mass of a lamina.

Since we are only asked for the centroid of the reqion, rather than the mass or moments of the associated lamina, we know the density constant ρ cancels out of the calculations eventually.Therefore,for the sake of convenience, let's assume ρ=1

First, we need to calculate the total mass:

m = ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = ∫₀⁴√x dx = (2/3)x³/²|₀⁴ = (2/3)[8-0] = 16/3

Next,we compute the moments

Mx = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²/2 dx = ∫₀⁴ x/2 dx = (1/4)x²|₀⁴ = 4

and

Mᵧ = ρ∫ₐᵇ xf(x)dx = ∫₀⁴ x√x dx = ∫₀⁴ x³/² dx = (2/5)x⁵/²|₀⁴ = (2/5)[32-0] = 64/5.

Thus, we have

x̄=Mᵧ/m=(64/5)/(16/3)=(64/5)*(3/16)=12/5 and ȳ=Mₓ/m=4/(16/3)=3/4.

The centroid of the region is (12/5, 3/4) .

2.31 Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=x^2$ and below by the x-axis over the interval [0, 2] . Find the centroid of the region.

We can adapt this approach to find centroids of more complex regions as well. Suppose our region is bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ as before, but now, instead of having the lower bound for the region be the x-axis, suppose the region is bounded below by the graph of a second continuous function, $g(x)$ ,as shown in the following figure.

Figure 2.68 A region between two functions.

Again, we partition the interval $[a,b]$ and construct rectangles.A representative rectangle is shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fgg6adQE8zQLDSywFb5XmMlnge8AZGsZW.png)

Fiqure 2.69 A representative rectangle of the region between two functions

Note that the centroid of this rectangle is (xᵢ*, (f(xᵢ*) + g(xᵢ*))/2) We won't go through allthe details of the Riemann sum development, but let's look at some of the key steps. In the development of the formulas for the mass of the lamina and the moment with respect to the y-axis,the height of each rectangle is given by $f(x_{i}^{*})-g(x_{i}^{*})$ , which leads to the expression $f(x)-g(x)$ in the integrands.

In the development of the formula for the moment with respect to the x-axis, the moment of each rectangle is found by multiplying the area of the rectangle, ρ[f(xᵢ*)-g(xᵢ*)]Δx ,by the distance of the centroid from the x-axis (f(xᵢ*)+g(xᵢ*))/2 , which gives ρ(1/2){[f(xᵢ*)]²-[g(xᵢ*)]²}Δx Summarizing these findings, we arrive at the following theorem

### Theorem 2.13

### Center of Mass of a Lamina Bounded by Two Functions

Let R denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ ，below by the graph of the continuous function $g(x)$ , and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=E$ , respectively. Let ρ denote the density of the associated lamina.Then we can make the following statements

i.The mass of the lamina is

m=ρ∫_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]dx

ii.The moments $M_{x}$ and $M_{y}$ of thelamina withrespect to the $X=$ and y-axes, respectively, are
Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ(1/2)[(f(x))² - (g(x))²] dx and Mᵧ = ρ∫ₐᵇx[f(x) - g(x)]dx

ili.The coordinates of the center of mass $(x,y)$ are

x̄=Mᵧ/m and ȳ=Mₓ/m

We illustrate this theorem in the following example

### EXAMPLE 2.32

### Finding the Centroid of a Region Bounded by Two Functions Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=1-x^{2}$ and below by the graph of the function

$g(x)=x-1.$ Find thecentroid of theregion

## $②$ Solution

The reqion is depicted in the following fiqure

![](./images/fglLF9ApOIt3C4m7qHnGYCZXTk1vcfPtz.png)

Figure 2.70 Finding the centroid of a region between two curves

The graphs of the functions intersect at (-2,-3) and (1,0) , So we integrate from -2 to 1. Once again, for the sake of convenience, assume ρ=1

First,weneed to calculate the total mass:

m = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx = ∫₋₂¹[1-x²-(x-1)]dx = ∫₋₂¹(2-x²-x)dx = [2x-(1/3)x³-(1/2)x²]|₋₂¹ = [2-(1/3)-(1/2)]-[-4+(8/3)-2] = 9/2.

Next, we compute the moments.

Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ(1/2)[(f(x))²-(g(x))²]dx = (1/2)∫₋₂¹((1-x²)²-(x-1)²)dx = (1/2)∫₋₂¹(x⁴-3x²+2x)dx = (1/2)[x⁵/5-x³+x²]|₋₂¹ = -27/10

and

Mᵧ = ρ∫ₐᵇ x[f(x)-g(x)]dx = ∫₋₂¹ x[(1-x²)-(x-1)]dx = ∫₋₂¹ x[2-x²-x]dx = ∫₋₂¹ (2x-x³-x²)dx = [x² - x⁴/4 - x³/3]|₋₂¹ = -9/4.

Therefore, we have

x̄=Mᵧ/m=-9/4⋅2/9=-1/2 and ȳ=Mₓ/m=-27/10⋅2/9=-3/5.

Thecentroid of theregion is (-(1/2) ,-(3/5))

2.32 Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=6-x^2$ and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=3-2x.$ Find the centroid of the region.

## The Symmetry Principle

We stated the symmetry principle earlier, when we were looking at the centroid of a rectangle. The symmetry principle can be a great help when finding centroids of regions that are symmetric. Consider the following example

# EXAMPLE 2.33

### Finding the Centroid of a Symmetric Region Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=4-x^{2}$ and below by the x-axis. Find the centroid

of the region.

## $②$ Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure.

![](./images/frHZYpWqOUdcFset9dqNruNs7m9IP1xs8.png)

Figure 2.71 We can use the symmetry principle to help find the centroid of a symmetric region

The region is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.Therefore, the x-coordinate of the centroid is zero. We need only calculate y. Once again, for the sake of convenience, assume ρ=1

First, we calculate the total mass:

m = ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = ∫₋₂² (4 - x²)dx = [4x - x³/3]|₋₂² = 32/3

Next, we calculate the moments. We only need $M_{x}$

Mₓ = ρ∫_(a)^(b)[f(x)]²/2dx = 1/2∫_(-2)^(2)[4-x²]²dx = 1/2∫_(-2)^(2)(16-8x²+x⁴)dx = 1/2[x⁵/5 - 8x³/3 + 16x]|_(-2)^(2) = 256/15

Then we have

ȳ=Mₓ/m=256/15⋅3/32=8/5.

The centroid of the region is (0,8/5)

### STUDENT PROJECT

## The Grand Canyon Skywalk

The Grand Canyon Skywalk opened to the public on March 28, 2007. This engineering marvel is a horseshoe-shaped observation platform suspended 4ooo ft above the Colorado River on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystalclear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).

![](./images/fCd860gg83rIRuiCY0vLFkGHnyk3gdZgw.png)
Figure 2.72 The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta, Wikimedia

Commons)

The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with no visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are engineered to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support posts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake within 50mi , and is capable of supporting more than 70,o00,o00 Ib.

One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate the center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the observation platform.

The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors' center 48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.

To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the xy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each subregion separately. The first region, denoted $R_{1}$ ,consists of the curved part of the U. Wemodel $R_1$ as a semicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).

![](./images/fTdBG8wsN1sWm7hgNqzPC7tdBipbvmGcG.png)
Figure 2.73 We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions

The legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between Rₗ and the canyon wall, comprise the second sub-region, $R_{2}.$ Last, the ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise the third sub-region, $R_3$ .Assume the density of the lamina is constant and assume the total weight of the platform is 1,20o,ooo Ib (not including the weight of the visitor center; we will consider that later). Use $g=32$ ft/sec2

1.Compute the area of each of the three sub-regions. Note that the areas of regions $R_2$ and $R_3$ should include the areas of the legs only, not the open space between them. Round answers to the nearest square foot. 2.Determine the mass associated with each of the three sub-regions 3.Calculate the center of mass of each of the three sub-regions. 4.Now, treat each of the three sub-regions as a point mass located at the center of mass of the corresponding subregion. Using this representation, calculate the center of mass of the entire platform. 5.Assume the visitor center weighs 2,20o,oo0 Ib, with a center of mass corresponding to the center of mass of $R_3$ Treating the visitor center as a point mass, recalculate the center of mass of the system. How does the center of mass change? 6.Although the Skywalk was built to limit the number of people on the observation platform to 120, the platform is capable of supporting up to 800 people weighing 200 Ib each. If all 800 people were allowed on the platform, and all of them went to the farthest end of the platform,how would the center of gravity of the system be affected? (Include the visitor center in the calculations and represent the people by a point mass located at the farthest edge of the platform, 70 ft from the canyon wall.)

# Theorem of Pappus

Thissection ends with a discussion of the theorem ofPappus for volume,which allowsusto find thevolume of particular kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the theorem for volume.

### Theorem 2.14

### Theorem of Pappus for Volume

Let Rbe a region in the plane and let/be a line in theplane that does not intersect R.Then the yolume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around /is equal to the area of $R$ multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid of R.

## Proof

We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function $f(x)$ and below by the graph of a. function $g(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$ , and for which the axis of revolution is the y-axis. In this case, the area of the region 5 A=∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>[f(x)-g(x)]dx depends only on the $x.$ coordinate of the centroid, $X$ which is

x = Mᵧ/m,

where

m=ρ∫_[a]^[b](f(x)-g(x))dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫_[a]^[b]x(f(x)-g(x))dx

Then,

d = 2π(ρ∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx)/(ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx)

and thus

d⋅A=2π∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx

However, using the method of cylindrical shells, we have

V=2π∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx.

So,

V=d⋅A

and the proof is complete.

# 2.7 Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms

### Learning Objectives

2.7.1 Write the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral. 2.7.2 Recognize the derivative of the natural logarithm 2.7.3 Integrate functions involving the natural logarithmic function 2.7.4 Define the number $e$ through an integral. 2.7.5 Recognize the derivative and integral of the exponential function 2.7.6 Prove properties of logarithms and exponential functions using integrals 2.7.7 Express general logarithmic and exponential functions in terms of natural logarithms and exponentials

We already examined exponential functions and logarithms in earlier chapters. However, we glossed over some key details in the previous discussions. For example, we did not study how to treat exponential functions with exponents that are irrational. The definition of the number e is another area where the previous development was somewhat incomplete. We now have the tools to deal with these concepts in a more mathematically rigorous way, and we do so in this section.

For purposes of this section, assume we have not yet defined the natural logarithm, the number e, or any of the integration and differentiation formulas associated with these functions.By the end of the section, we will have studied these concepts in a mathematically rigorous way (and we will see they are consistent with the concepts we learned earlier).

We begin the section by defining the natural logarithm in terms of an integral. This definition forms the foundation for the section. From this definition, we derive differentiation formulas, define the number e, and expand these concepts tc logarithms and exponential functions of any base.

## The Natural Logarithm as an Integral

Recall the power rule for integrals:.

∫xⁿdx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C, n≠-1.

Clearly, tisdoes not work when $n=-1$ a itwould force us to dideby ero. So, what do wedo with ∫(1/x)dx? Recal from th Ffundamentl Theorem of cacusthat ∫₁ˣ 1/t dt isan antideriatve of $1/x$ Therefore we can make the following definition.

### Definition

For $x>0$ , define the natural logarithm function by

ln x = ∫₁ˣ (1/t)dt

For $x>1$ ,this s just thearea under the curve $y=1/t$ from1to $x$ For $x<1$ we have dt = --dt,sointhis case it is the negative of the area under the curve from $x$ to 1 (see the following figure)

![](./images/fAbaG2TanHfqyR2IsFdvx4u8fvxphwTst.png)
Figure 2.75 (a) When $x>1$ , the natural logarithm is the area under the curve $y=1/t$ from 1 to x. (b) When $x<1$, the

natural logarithm is the negative of the area under the curve from $x$ to 1

Notice that In 1=0 . Furthermore, the function $y=1/t>0$ for $x>0$ . Therefore, by the properties of integrals, it is clear that In $x$ is increasing for $x>0$

## Properties of the Natural Logarithm

Because of the way we defined the natural logarithm, the following differentiation formula falls out immediately as a result of to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

### Theorem 2.15

### Derivative of the Natural Logarithm

For $x>0$ ,the derivative of the natural logarithm is givenby

d/dx ln x = 1/x.

### Theorem 2.16

Corollary to the Derivatiye of the Natural Logarithm

The function In x is differentiable:therefore.it is continuous

A graph of ln $x$ ishown in igure2.76. Notice that itis continuous throughout its domain of (0,∞)

![](./images/fEn72RHwKNG9aQPUHIs6SzkPCGpXOVOVU.png)

Figure 2.76 The graph of f(x) = ln x shows that it is a continuous function.

### EXAMPLE 2.35

### Calculating Derivatives of Natural Logarithms Calculate the following derivatives:

a. d/dx ln(5x³-2) b. d/dx(ln(3x))²

### $①$ Solution

We need to apply the chain rule in both cases.

a. d/dx ln(5x³-2) = 15x²/(5x³-2) b. d/dx(ln(3x))² = (2(ln(3x))⋅3)/(3x) = 2(ln(3x))/x

·· 2.35 Calculate the following derivatives:

a. d/dx ln(2x²+x) b. d/dx(ln(x³))²

Note that if we use the absolute value function and create a new function In $|x|$ ,we can extend the domain of the natural logarithm to include $x<0$ Then $(d/(dx))$ ln $|x|=1/x.$ This gives rise to the familiar integration formula

### Theorem 2.17

### Integral of (1/u) du The natural logarithm is the antiderivative of the function f(u)=1/u


∫(1/u)du = ln|u| + C

### EXAMPLE 2.36

### Calculating Integrals Involving Natural Logarithms Calclate te negral ∫x/(x²+4)dx

### $②$ Solution

Using u-substitution, let $u=x^{2}+4.$ Then $du= 2x$ $dx$ and we have

∫x/(x²+4)dx = 1/2∫1/u du = 1/2ln|u| + C = 1/2ln|x²+4| + C = 1/2ln(x²+4) + C

 .3 Calclte heinegral ∫(x²/(x³+6))dx

Although we have called our function a *logarithm, we have not actually proved that any of the properties of logarithms hold for this function. We do so here.

### Theorem 2.18

### Properties of the Natural Logarithm

Ifa, $b>0$ and $r$ is a rational number, then

ln 1 = 0; ln(ab) = ln a + ln b; ln(a/b) = ln a - ln b; ln(aʳ) = r ln a

### Proof

1.Byderinton, i 1 1 = ∫₁¹ 1/t dt = 0.

 ii. We have

ln(ab) = ∫₁^(ab) 1/t dt = ∫₁^a 1/t dt + ∫ₐ^(ab) 1/t dt

Use $ld$ -substitution on the last integral in this expression.Let $u=t/a.$ Then du = (1/a)dt . Furthermore, when $t=a,u=1$ and when $t=ab,u=b$ So we get

ln(ab) = ∫₁ᵃ (1/t)dt + ∫ₐᵃᵇ (1/t)dt = ∫₁ᵃ (1/t)dt + ∫₁ᵇ (1/u)du = ln a + ln b

iv.Note that

d/dx ln(xʳ) = rxʳ⁻¹/xʳ = r/x

Furthermore,

d/dx(rlnx)=r/x

Since the derivatives of these two functions are the same, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, they must differ by a constant. So we have


ln(xʳ) = rln x + C

for some constant $C.$ Taking $x=1$, we get

ln(1<sup>r</sup>) = rln(1) + C; 0 = r(0) + C; C = 0

Thus ln(xʳ)=rlnx and the proof is complete. Note that we can extend this property to irrational values of $r$ later in this section. Part ii. follows from parts ii. and iv. and the proof is left to you.

### EXAMPLE 2.37

### Using Properties of Logarithms

Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm:

ln 9 - 2ln 3 + ln(1/3)

We have

ln9 - 2ln3 + ln(1/3) = ln(3²) - 2ln3 + ln(3⁻¹) = 2ln3 - 2ln3 - ln3 = -ln3

2.37 Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm:

ln8-ln2-ln(1/4).

## Defining the Number e

Now that we have the natural loaarithm defined. we can use that function to define the number e

### Definition

The number e is defined to be the real number such that

ln e = 1.

To put it another way, the area under the curve. $y=1/t$ between $t=1$ and $t=e$ is 1 (Fiqure 2.77). The proof that such a number exists and is unique is left to you.(Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove existence and the fact that In $x$ is increasing to prove uniqueness.)

![](./images/fVLcHuMoftYXGVvA1uS9LHIR4nqxagA1n.png)

Figure 2.77 The areaunder thecurve from 1 to $e$ is equal to one

The number e can be shown to be irrational, although we wont do so here (see the Student Project in Taylor and Maclaurin Series). Its approximate value is given by

e  2.71828182846.

## The Exponential Function

We now turn our attention to the function e^Y .Note that the natural logarithm is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function. For now, we denote this inverse function by exp $x$ Then,

exp(ln x) = x for x > 0 and ln(exp x) = x for all x.

The following figure shows the graphs of exp $x$ and ln x

![](./images/f5qTzxyuswZGBZZxWVWgNEYHpnv7mM3Sd.png)
Figure 2.78 The graphs of ln x and exp x

We hypothesize that exp $x=e^x.$ For rational values of $x$ , this is easy to show. If $x$ is rational, then we have ln(eˣ) = x In $e=x$ Thus, when $x$ is rational, eˣ=exp x .For irrational values of $x$ , we simply define $e^x$ as the inverse function of In $x$

### Definition

For any real number $x$ ,define $y=e^{X}$ to be the number for which

lny=ln(eˣ)=x

Then we have eˣ = exp(x) for all X .and thus


e^ln x = x for x>0 and ln(eˣ) = x

for all $X$

### Properties of the Exponential Function

Since the exponential function was defined in terms of an inverse function, and not in terms of a power of e,we must verify that the usual laws of exponentshold for the function $e^{X}$

### Theorem 2.19

### Properties of the Exponential Function

If $P$ and $q$ are any real numbers and $r$ is a rational number, then

i. ee9 = e+q 1. e<sup>p</sup>/e<sup>q</sup>=e<sup>p-q</sup> il. (eP)r = epr

### Proof

Note that if $P$ and $q$ are rational, the properties hold. However, if $P$ or $q$ are irrational, we must apply the inverse function definition of $e^{X}$ and verify the properties. Only the first property is verified here; the other two are left to you. We have

ln(e^p e^q)=ln(e^p)+ln(e^q)=p+q=ln(e^(p+q)).

Since In $x$ is one-to-one, then

$$e^{p}e^{q}=e^{p+q}.$$

口

As with part iv.of the loqarithm properties,we can extend property ii.to irrational values of $I$ and we do so by the enc of the section.

We also want to verify the differentiation formula for the function $y=e^{x}.$ To do this, we need to use implicit differentiation. Let $y=e^{X}$ . Then

lny = x, (1/y)(dy/dx) = 1, dy/dx = y

Thus, we see

d/dx eˣ=eˣ

as desired, which leads immediately to the integration formula

∫e<sup>x</sup>dx=e<sup>x</sup>+C

We apply these formulas in the following examples

## General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

We close this section by looking at exponential functions and logarithms with bases other than e. Exponential functions are functions of the form $f(x)=a^{X}$ . Note that unless $a=e$ ,we still do not have a mathematically rigorous definition of these functions for irrational exponents. Let's rectify that here by defining the function f(x) = aᵀ interms of the exponential function. $e^{x}$ .We then examine logarithms with bases other than e as inverse functions of exponential functions.

### Definition

For any $a>0$ and for any real number x,define $y=a^{x}$ as follows:

y = aˣ = e^(xln a)

Now aˣ is defined rigorously for all values of $X.$ This definition also allows us to generalize property iv. of logarithms and property ii. of exponential functions to apply to both rational and irrational values of $r$ It isstraightforward to show that properties of exponents hold for general exponentialfunctions defined in this way.

Let'snow apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for aˣ We have

d/dx aˣ = d/dx eˣˡⁿᵃ = eˣˡⁿᵃ ln a = aˣ ln a.

The corresponding integration formula follows immediately

### Theorem 2.20

### Derivatives and Integrals Involying General Exponential Functions

Let $a>0$ Then,

d/dx aˣ=aˣln a

and

∫aˣdx = (1/ln a)aˣ + C.

If a≠1 , then the function $a^{x}$ is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by logₐx .Then,

y = logax if and only if $x=a^{y}$

Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y=logₐx. Then, $x=a^{y}$ Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get

lnx = ln(aʸ), lnx = y lna, y = lnx/lna, logₐx = lnx/lna.

Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this formula to find a differentiation formula for a logarithm with base α.Again, let y = logax Then,

dy/dx = d/dx(logₐx) = d/dx(lnx/lna) = (1/lna)d/dx(lnx) = 1/(lna)⋅1/x = 1/(x lna)

### Theorem 2.21

Derivatives of General Logarithm Functions Let $a>0.$ Then,

d/dx logₐx=1/(xln a).

# 2.8 Exponential Growth and Decay

### Learning Objectives

2.8.1 Use the exponential growth model in applications, including population growth and compounc interest. 2.8.2 Explain the concept of doubling time 2.8.3 Use the exponential decay model in applications, including radioactive decay and Newton's law o. cooling 2.8.4Explain the concept of half-life

One of the most prevalent applications of exponential functions involves growth and decay models. Exponential growth and decay show up in a host of natural applications.From population growth and continuously compounded interest to radioactive decay and Newton's law of cooling, exponential functions are ubiquitous in nature. In this section, we examine exponential growth and decay in the context of some of these applications

## Exponential Growth Model

Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form $y=y_{0}e^{kt}$ ,where $y_{0}$ represents the initial state of the system and $k$ is a positive constant, called the growth constant.Notice that in an exponential growth

model, we have

$$y'=ky_{0}e^{kt}=ky.$$

That is,the rate of qrowth is proportional to the current function value.This is akey feature of exponential qrowth Eguation 2.27 involves derivatives and is called a differentia/ eauation, We learn more about differential eguations in Introduction to Differential Equations.

### Rule: Exponential Growth Model

Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model

$$y=y_0e^{kt},$$

where $y_{0}$ represents the initial state of the system and $k>0$ is a constant, called the growth constant

Population growth js a common example of exponential arowth.Consider a population of bacteria.for instance. It seems plausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria there are to reproduce, the faster the population grows. Figure 2.79 and Table 2.1 represent the growth of a population of bacteria with an initial population of 200 bacteria and a growth constant of 0.02. Notice that after only 2 hours (120 minutes),the population is 10 times its oriqinal size

Table 2.1 Exponential Growth of a Bacteria Population

Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At any given time, the realworld population contains a whole number of bacteria, although the model takes on noninteger values.When using exponential growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are modeling.

# EXAMPLE 2.42

## Population Growthe Consider the population of bacteria described earlier This population grows according to the function $f(t)=200e^{0.02t}$

where tis measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 5 hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000 bacteria?

![](./images/fl6DACRgE8SOxbcKGq0brkh9Gg45tEhcH.png)
Wehave $f(t)=200e^{0.02t}$ Then

### Solution

f(300)=200e^(0.02(300))≈80,686

There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours.

To find when the population reaches 100.o00 bacteria, we solve the equatior

100,000 = 200e^(0.02t) 500 = e^(0.02t) ln500 = 0.02t t = ln500/0.02 ≈ 310.73.

The population reaches 100,000 bacteria after 310.73 minutes.

![](./images/f2IKk2zXyo2efyZBkC2R6Ni7XiG6EasgT.png)

2.42 Consider a population of bacteria that grows according to the function $f(t)=500e^{0.05t}$ , where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 4 hours? When does the population reach 100 million bacteria?

Let's now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest. Interest that is not compounded is called simple interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually 1 year). So, if we put $s1000$ in a savings account earning 2% simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have

$1000(1+0.02)=1020.$$

Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period.Therefore,if the bank compounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year's interest to the account after 6 months. During the second half of the year, the account earns interest not only on the initial $S1000$ ,but also on the interestearned during the first half of the year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have

1000(1+0.02/2)²=81020.10

Similarly, if the interest is compounded every 4 months, we have

$1000(1+0.02/3)³=1020.13,$$

and if the interest is compounded daily (365 times per year),we have <1020.20$ If we extend this concept,so that the interest is compounded continuously, after t years we have

1000lim_(n→∞)(1+0.02/n)^(nt)

Now let's manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number e can be expressed as a limit

e = lim(m→∞) (1 + 1/m)ᵐ

Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form $(1+1/m)$ . Let $n=0.02m$ Note that as n→∞, m→∞ as well. Then we get

1000 lim(n→∞)(1 + 0.02/n)^(nt) = 1000 lim(m→∞)(1 + 0.02/(0.02m))^(0.02mt) = 1000[lim(m→∞)(1 + 1/m)^m]^(0.02t)

We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number e.So, the balance in our bank account after $l$ years is given by $1000e^{0.02r}$ .Generalizing this concept, we see that if a bank account with an initial balance of <P$ earns interest at arate of r% ,compounded continuously, then the balance of the account after f years is

Balance=Pe^(rt)

# EXAMPLE 2.43

## Compound Interest

A 25-year-old student is offered an opportunity to invest some money in a retirement account that pays 5% annual interest compounded continuously. How much does the student need to invest today to have <1$ million when she retires at age 65? what if she could earn 6% annual interest compounded continuously instead?

## $②$ Solution

We have

$1,000,000=Pe⁰·⁰⁵(⁴⁰) P=135,335.28She must invest 135,335.28 at 5% interest

If, instead, she is able to earn 6% , then the equation becomes.

1,000,000 = Pe⁰·⁰⁶⁽⁴⁰⁾, P = 90,717.95

In this case, she needs to invest only S90,717.95. This is roughly two-thirds the amount she needs to invest at 5% .The fact that the interest is compounded continuously greatly magnifies the effect of the 1% increase in interest rate.

If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant. In other words, it takes the same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from 100 to 200 bacteria as it does to grow from 10.000 to

20,0o0 bacteria. This time is called the doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity reaches twice its oriqinal size. So we have

2y₀=y₀eᵏᵗ, 2=eᵏᵗ, ln2=kt, t=ln2/k

### Definition

If a quantity grows exponentially, the doubling time is the amount of time it takes the quantity to double. It is given by

Doubling time = ln2/k.

## EXAmpLE 2.44

### Using the Doubling Time

Assume a population of fish grows exponentially. A pond is stocked initially with 500 fish. After 6 months, there are 1000 fish in the pond. The owner will allow his friends and neighbors to fish on his pond after the fish population reaches 10,000. when will the owner's friends be allowed to fish?

## $②$ Solution

We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size.So, if t represents time in months, by the doubling time formula, we have 6 = (ln2)/k Then, k = (ln 2)/6 .Thus, the population is given by y=500e^((ln2)/6)t . To figureout when the population reaches 10,000 fish,we must solve the following equation:

10,000 = 500e^(ln2/6)t; 20 = e^(ln2/6)t; ln20 = (ln2/6)t; t = 6(ln20)/ln2 ≈ 25.93

The owner's friends have to wait 25.93 months (a little more than 2 years) to fish in the pond

2.44 Suppose it takes 9 months for the fish population in Example 2.44 to reach 1000 fish. Under these circumstances, how long do the owner's friends have to wait

# Exponential Decay Model

Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for example), or chemical compounds that break down over time.We say that such systems exhibit exponential decay,rather than exponential growth. The model is nearly the same, except there is a negative sign in the exponent. Thus, for some positive constant $k$ , we have $y=y_{0}e^{-kt}$

As with exponential growth, there is a differential equation associated with exponential decay. We have

$$y'=-ky_{0}e^{-kt}=-ky.$$

##  Rule: Exponential Decay Model

Systems that exhibit exponential decay behave according to the model

$$y=y_0e^{-kt},$$

where $y_0$ represents the initial state of the system and $k>0$ is a constant,called the decay constant

The followinq fiqure shows a qraph of a representative exponential decay function

![](./images/fciXBs8rZuL0g8Nb1uiUf5E79suTvPOIH.png)
Figure 2.80 An example of exponential decay

Let's look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton's law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings. In other words, if $T$ represents the temperature of the object and $T_{a}$ represents the ambient temperature in a room, then

T' = -k(T - Tₐ)

Note that this is not auite the riaht model for exponential decay.We want the derivative to be proportional to the function, and this expression has the additional $T_{a}$ term.Fortunately,we canmake a change of variables that resolves this issue. Let $y(t)=T(t)-T_{a}$, Then 
y'(t) = T'(t) - 0 = T'(t), and our equation becomes

$$y'=-ky.$$

From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus

$$y=y_{0}e^{-kt},$$

and we see that

T-Tₐ=(T₀-Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ, T=(T₀-Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ+Tₐ

where $T_0$ represents the initial temperature. Let's apply this formula in the following example

### EXAMPLE 2.45

### Newton's Law of Cooling

According to experienced baristas, the optimal temperature to serve coffee is between 155°F and 175°F. Suppose coffee is poured at a temperature of 200°F and after 2 minutes in a 70°F room it has cooled to 180°F .When is the coffee first cool enough to serve?When is the coffee too cold to serve?Round answers to the nearest half minute

## $②$ Solution

We have

T = (T₀-Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ + Tₐ; 180 = (200-70)e⁻ᵏ⁽²⁾ + 70; 110 = 130e⁻²ᵏ; 11/13 = e⁻²ᵏ; ln(11/13) = -2k; ln11 - ln13 = -2k; k = (ln13 - ln11)/2.

Then, the model is

T=130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t+70

The coffee reaches 175°F when

175=130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t+70; 105=130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t; 21/26=e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t; ln(21/26)=(ln11-ln13)/2t; ln21-ln26=(ln11-ln13)/2t; t=2(ln21-ln26)/(ln11-ln13)≈2.56.

The coffee can be served about 2.5 minutes after it is poured. The coffee reaches 155°F at

155 = 130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t + 70, 85 = 130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t, 17/26 = e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t, ln17 - ln26 = ((ln11 - ln13)/2)t, t = 2(ln17 - ln26)/(ln11 - ln13) ≈ 5.09

The coffee is too cold to be served about 5 minutes after it is poured.

![](./images/fiEalgf34hlholqTIwD5CB7E7g9PPUpsV.png)

2.45 Suppose the room is warmer 75°F) and, after 2 minutes, the coffee has cooled only to 185°F. When isthe coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee be too cold to serve? Round answers to the nearest half minute.

Just as systems exhibiting exponential growth have a constant doubling time, systems exhibiting exponential decay have a constant half-life. To calculate the half-life, we want to know when the quantity reaches half its original size. Therefore, we have

y₀/2 = y₀e⁻ᵏᵗ; 1/2 = e⁻ᵏᵗ; -ln2 = -kt; t = ln2/k

Note: This is the same expression we came up with for doubling time.

### Definition

If a quantity decays exponentially, the half-life is the amount of time it takes the quantity to be reduced by half. It is given by

Half-life = ln2/k

# EXAMPLE 2.46

###  Radiocarbon Dating

One of the most common applications of an exponential decay model is carbon dating. Carbon-14 decays (emits a

radioactive particle) at a reqular and consistent exponential rate. Therefore, if we know how much carbon was oriqinall present in an object and how much carbon remains, we can determine the age of the object.The half-life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years--meaning, after that many years, half the material has converted from the original carbon-14 to the new nonradioactive nitrogen-14. If we have $100g$ carbon-14 today, how much is left in 50 years? If an artifact that originally contained $100g$ of carbon now contains $10g$ of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years.

### Solution

We have

5730 = ln2/k, k = ln2/5730

So, the model says

y=100e⁻⁽ˡⁿ²/⁵⁷³⁰⁾ᵗ.

In 50 years, we have

y=100e⁻⁽ˡⁿ²⁵⁷³⁰⁾(⁵⁰) ≈99.40

Therefore, in 50 years, 99.40 g of carbon-14 remains.

To determine the aae of the artifact we must solve

10=100e^(-(ln2/5730)t)
1/10=e^(-(ln2/5730)t)
t≈19035.

The artifact is about 19.000 years old

![](./images/fryd3xr5lspx1vGkE7KfUMtvQH9Dt0bCh.png)

2.46 If we have 100 g of carbon-14, how much is left after 500 years? If an artifact that originally contained 100 g of carbon now contains $20g$ of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years

# 2.9 Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions.

### Learning Objectives

2.9.1 Apply the formulas for derivatives and integrals of the hyperbolic functions 2.9.2 Apply the formulas for the derivatives of the inverse hyperbolic functions and their associatec integrals. 2.9.3 Describe the common applied conditions of a catenary curve.

We were introduced to hyperbolic functions in Introduction to Functions and Graphs (http:/openstax.org/books/. calculus-volume-1/pages/1-5-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions), along with some of their basic properties. In this section, we look at differentiation and integration formulas for the hyperbolic functions and their inverses

## Derivatives and Integrals of the Hyperbolic Functions.

Recall that the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are defined as

sinh x = (eˣ - e⁻ˣ)/2 and cosh x = (eˣ + e⁻ˣ)/2

The other hyperbolic functions are then defined in terms of sinh $x$ and cosh $x$ . The graphs of the hyperbolic functions are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fBOS5zI1dPccuM1zxrqmm1I4SGoWeZMNd.png)
Figure 2.81 Graphs of the hyperbolic functions

It is easy to develop differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions.For example,looking at sinh x x $x$ we have

d/dx(sinh x) = d/dx((eˣ-e⁻ˣ)/2) = 1/2[d/dx(eˣ)-d/dx(e⁻ˣ)] = 1/2[eˣ+e⁻ˣ] = cosh x

Similarly, (d/dx) cosh x = sinh x .We summarize the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions in the following table.

Table 2.2Derivatives of the Hyperbolic Functions

![](./images/fY5dnP85kgnumPUhlo6PMGkeqLWHnuNdg.png)

Table 2.2 Derivatives of the Hyperbolic Functions

Let's take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standarc trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine functions match: (d/dx) sin x=cos x and (d/dx) sinh x = cosh x The derivatives of the cosine functions,however, differ in sign: (d/dx) cos x=-sinx ,but (d/dx) cosh x = sinh x . As we continue our examination of the hyperbolic functions we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions

These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral formulas
∫sinh u du = cosh u + C
∫cosh²u du = -coth u + C
∫cosh u du = sinh u + C
∫sech u tanh u du = -sech u + C
∫sech²u du = tanh u + C
∫cosh u coth u du = -csch u + C

# EXAMPLE 2.47

### Differentiating Hyperbolic Functions

Evaluate the following derivatives:

a. d/dx(sinh(x²)) b. d/dx(cosh x)²

## $②$ Solution

Using the formulas in Table 2.2 and the chain rule, we get

a. d/dx(sinh(x²)) = cosh(x²)⋅2x b. d/dx(cosh x)²=2cosh x sinh x

2.47 Evaluate the following derivatives a.(tanh (x² + 3x)) b. d/dx(1/(sinh x)²) 

# EXAMPLE 2.48

### Integrals Involving Hyperbolic Functions

Evaluate the following integrals:

# ∫ tanh x $dx$ / ∫xcosh(x²)dx ∫ tanh x $dx$

### $②$ Solution

We can use u-substitution in both cases.

a.Let $u=x^{2}$ Then, $du=2x$ dx and
∫xcosh(x²)dx = ½cosh u du = ½sinh u + C = ½sinh(x²) + C

b.Let u=cosh x .Then, du=sinh x $dx$ and
∫tanh x dx = ∫(sinh x)/(cosh x)dx = ∫1/u du = ln|u| + C = ln|cosh x| + C.

Note that cosh $x>0$ for all $x$ , so we can eliminate the absolute value signs and obtain
∫tanh x dx = ln(cosh x) + C

### Calculus of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

Looking at the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that with appropriate range restrictions, they all have inverses Most of the necessary range restrictions can be discerned by close examination of the graphs. The domains and ranges of the inverse hyperbolic functions are summarized in the following table.

Function|Domain|Range<br>sinh$^{-1}$ X|(−∞,∞)|−∞,∞<br>cosh$^{-1}$ x|[1,∞)|[0,∞)<br>tanh$^{-1}$ x|(-1,1)|−∞,∞<br>coth$^{-1}$ x|(−∞,-1)∪(1,∞)|(−∞,0)∪(0,∞)<br>sech$^{-1}$ x|(0,1]|[0,∞)<br>csch$^{-1}$ x||<br>

Table 2.3 Domains and Ranges of the Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fhu83v0UGr74C8EO8xQpDhHFzm0nYsNWI.png)
Figure 2.82 Graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions.

To find the derivatives of the inverse functions, we use implicit differentiation.We have

y = sinh⁻¹x, sinh y = x, (d/dx)sinh y = (d/dx)x, cosh y(dy/dx) = 1.

Recall that 
cosh²y - sinh²y = 1 ,SOcos iy = √(1+sinh²y) Then

dy/dx = 1/cosh y = 1/√(1+sinh²y) = 1/√(1+x²)

We can derive differentiation formulas for the other inverse hyperbolic functions in a similar fashion.These differentiation formulas are summarized in the following table

![](./images/fTreNOZ2X8FtRKAwtp55sImBunTS67PsO.png)

Table 2.4 Derivatives of the Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

Note that the derivatives of tanh⁻¹x and $coth^{-1}x$ are the same.Thus,when we integrate 1/(1 - x²), we need to select theproper antiderivative based on the domain of thefunctions and the valuesof X . Integration formulas involving the inverse hyperbolic functions are summarized as follows.

∫(1/√(1+u²))du = sinh⁻¹u + C, ∫(1/(u√(1-u²)))du = -sech⁻¹|u| + C, ∫(1/√(u²-1))du = cosh⁻¹u + C, ∫(1/(u√(1+u²)))du = -csch⁻¹|u| + C, ∫(1/(1-u²))du = {tanh⁻¹u + C if |u| < 1, cosh⁻¹u + C if |u| > 1}

 EXAMPLE 2.49

a. d/dx(sinh⁻¹(x/3)) b. d/dx(tanh⁻¹x)²

### $②$ Solution

Using the formulas in Table 2.4 and the chain rule, we obtain the following results
d/dx(sinh⁻¹(x/3)) = 1/(3√(1+x²/9)) = 1/√(9+x²); d/dx(tanh⁻¹x)² = 2(tanh⁻¹x)/(1-x²)

We can use $lt$ -substitution in both cases.

a.Let $u=2x$ Then, $du=2dx$ and we have
uu=2ux and we have ∫1/√(4x²-1)dx=∫1/(2√(u²-1))du=(1/2)cosh⁻¹u+C=(1/2)cosh⁻¹(2x)+C.

### Applications

One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform density is suspended between two supports without any load other than its own weight,the cable forms a curve called a catenary. Highvoltage power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and strands of a spider's web all form catenaries. The following figure shows chains hanging from a row of posts.

Figure 2.83 Chains between these posts take the shape of a catenary.(credit: modification of work by

OKFoundryCompany, Flickr)

Hyperbolic functions can be used to model catenaries. Specifically, functions of the form y=α $y=a$ y=a cosh(x/a) are catenaries Eigure 2.84 shows the graph of $y=2$ $y=2$ y = 2cosh(x/2)

Figure 2.84 A hyperbolic cosine function forms the shape of a catenary

### EXAMPLE 2.51

### Using a Catenary to Find the Lenqth of a Cable

Assume a hanging cable has the shape 10 cosh (x/10) for -15≤x≤15 ,where $x$ is measured in feet. Determine the length of the cable(in feet).

Solution Recall from Section 2.4 that the formula for arc length i.

Arc Length=∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx

We have f(x)=10cosh(x/10) , SO f'(x) = sinh(x/10) Then

Arc Length =∫(from a to b)√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx =∫(from -15 to 15)√(1+sinh²(x/10))dx

Now recall that 1 + sinh²x = cosh²x, So we haVe
Arc Length = ∫₋₁₅¹⁵√(1+sinh²(x/10))dx = ∫₋₁₅¹⁵cosh(x/10)dx = 10sinh(x/10)|₋₁₅¹⁵ = 10[sinh(3/2)-sinh(-3/2)] = 20sinh(3/2) ≈ 42.586 ft. 

2.51 Assume a hanging cable has the shape 15 cosh (x/15) for -20 ≤ x ≤ 20 Determine the length of the cable (in feet).

# Key Concepts

## 2.1 Areas between Curves.

·Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be used to find the area betweer two curves ·To find the areabetween two curves defined by functions,integrate the differenceof the functions •If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex,use the absolute value of the difference of the functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of the region ·Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to yto find the area. The principles are the same regardless of which variable is used as the variable of integration.

## 2.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing

Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by integrating the cross-sectional area. ·For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The method of disks involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-sections are circles, and using the formula for the area of a circle. If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of washers, the area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating

## 2.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

·The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite integral to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution. This method is sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of washers because we integrate with respect to the other variable. In some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than the other. ·The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are the main factors in deciding which integratior

method to use.

## 2.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

·The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral. ·The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum. Taking a limit then gives us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of y. ·The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution ·The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult to evaluate. It may be necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals

## 2.5 Physical Applications

Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics. •Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known. ·Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of gravity, as in a pumping problem ·Definite integralscan alsobe used tocalculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid

## 2.6 Moments and Centers of Mass

·Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of mass can be thought of as the balancing point of the system. ·For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is M=∑_(i=1)^n mᵢxᵢ. For point mass distributedi a plae,the momentsof the system wth respet the $X.$ and

J-axes, repetivel are Mₓ=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢyᵢ and Mᵧ=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢxᵢ, respectively ·For a lamina bounded above by a function $f(x)$ ,the moments of the system with respect to the $x.$ and y-axes respetivel are Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²/2 dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x)dx ·The $x.$ and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around the yaxis and arounc

the x-axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says that if a region is symmetric with respect to a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line ·The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region

## 2.9 Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions

 Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiatior formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas. With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses Implicit differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the inverse hyperbolic functions, which in turn give rise tc integration formulas. : The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries.

### Introduction

In a large city, accidents occurred at an average rate of one every three months at a particularly busy intersection. After residents complained, changes were made to the traffic lights at the intersection. It has now been eight months since the changes were made and there have been no accidents. Were the changes effective or is the eight-month interval without an accident a result of chance? We explore this question later in this chapter and see that integration is an essential part of determining the answer (see Example 3.49)

We saw in the previous chapter how important integration can be for all kinds of different topics—from calculations of volumes to flow rates, and from using a velocity function to determine a position to locating centers of mass. It is no surprise, then, that techniques for finding antiderivatives (or indefinite integrals) are important to know for everyone who uses them. We have already discussed some basic integration formulas and the method of integration by substitution. In this chapter, we study some additional techniques, including some ways of approximating definite integrals when normal techniques do not work.

# 3.1 Integration by Parts

## Learning Objectives

3.1.1 Recognize when to use integration by parts. 3.1.2 Use the integration-by-parts formula to solve integration problems. 3.1.3 Use the integration-by-parts formula for definite integrals.

By now we have a fairly thorough procedure for how to evaluate many basic integrals. However, although we car integrate ∫xsin(x²)dx by using the substitution, $u=x^{2}$ , omething as simple looking asxsinxdx defiesus.Man students want toknow whether there is a product rule forinteqration.There isn't,but there is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation that allows us to exchange oneintegral for another.We call this technique integration by parts.

### The Integration-by-Parts Formula

If $h(x)=f(x)g(x)$ , thenby using the product rule,we obtain 
h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x) Although at firstit may see ountetie, e' intrte h si o this quation ∫h'(x)dx=∫(g(x)f'(x)+f(x)g'(x))dx This gives us

h(x)=f(x)g(x)=∫g(x)f'(x)dx+∫f(x)g'(x)dx.

Nowwesle for 
∫f(x)g'(x)dx

∫f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) - ∫g(x)f'(x)dx

By making the substitutions $u=f(x)$ and $v=g(x)$ , which in turn make du = f'(x)dx and dv=g'(x)dx, we have the more compact form

∫udv=uv-∫vdu

### Theorem 3.1

### Integration by Parts

Let $u=f(x)$ and U=g(x) be functions with continuous derivatives. Then, the integration-by-parts formula for th integral involving these two functions is

∫udv=uv-∫vdu

The advantage of using the integration-by-parts formula is that we can use it to exchange one integral for another possibly easier, integral. The following example illustrates its use

# EXAMPLE 3.1

### Using Integration by Parts

Use integration by parts with $u=x$ and dv=sinx $dx$ to evaluate xsinx dx

### $②$ Solution By choosing $u=x$ ,we have $du=1dx$ Since dv=sinx $dx$, weget v=∫sinx dx = -cos x It is handy to keep track o

these values as follows:

u = x, dv = sinx dx; du = 1dx, v = ∫sinx dx = -cosx

Applying the integration-by-parts formula results in

∫xsinx dx = x(-cosx) - ∫(-cosx)(1)dx = -xcosx + ∫cosx dx = -xcosx + sinx + C

![](./images/fFpyicIPagyo0NUpQAdiGCTkrWktzaGSB.png)

### Analysis

At this point, there are probably a few items that need clarification. First of all, you may be curious about what would have happened if we had chosen u=sin x and $dv=x$ . If we had done so, then we would have du = cosx dxand

v=(1/2)x² Thus ate appin ntegraton by pats wehave ∫ x sin x dx = (1/2)x²sin x - ∫ (1/2)x²cos x $dx.$

Unfortunately, with the new integral, we are in no better position than before. It is important to keep in mind that wher we apply integration byparts,we may need to try several choicesfor $u$ and $dv$ before finding a choice that works.

Second, youmay wonderwhy when we find v = ∫ v = ∫ v = ∫ sin x dx = -cosx we do notuse v=-cos x+K To sethatit makes no difference, we can rework the problem using v=-cos x+K

∫xsin x dx = (x)(-cos x + K) - ∫(-cos x + K)(1 dx) = -xcos x + Kx + ∫cos x dx - ∫K dx = -xcos x + Kx + sin x - Kx + C = -xcos x + sin x + C.

As you can see, it makes no difference in the final solution

Last, we can check to make sure that our antiderivative is correct by differentiating -xcosx+sinx+C

d/dx(-xcos x + sin x + C) = (-1)cos x + (-x)(-sin x) + cos x = xsin x

Therefore, the antiderivative checks out

3.1 Evaluate xe2x dx using the integration-by-parts formula with u = x and du = e2x dx

The natural question to ask at this point is: How do we know how to choose u and $dv?$ Sometimes it is a matter of trial and error; however, the acronym LIATE can often help to take some of the guesswork out of our choices. This acronym stands for Logarithmic Functions, Inverse Trigonometric Functions, Algebraic Functions, Trigonometric Functions, and Exponential Functions.This mnemonicserves as an aid in determining an appropriate choice for u

The type of function in the integral that appears first in the list should be our first choice of u.For example, if an integral contains a logarithmic function and an algebraic function, we should choose $u$ to be the logarithmic function, because L comes before A in LIATE. The integral in Example 3.1 has a trigonometric function (sin x) and an algebraic function $(x)$ Because A comes before T in LIATE, we chose $u$ to be the algebraic function. When we have chosen u, $d_{U}$ is selected to be the remaining part of the function to be integrated, together with dx.

Why does this mnemonic work? Remember that whatever we pick to be $dv$ must be something we can integrate. Since we do not have integration formulas that allow us to integrate simple logarithmic functions and inverse trigonometric

functions, it makes sense that they should not be chosen as values for du. Consequently, they should be at the head of the list as choices for u. Thus, we put LI at the beginning of the mnemonic. (We could just as easily have started with IL, since these two types of functions won't appear together in an integration-by-parts problem.) The exponential and trigonometric functions are at the end of our list because they are fairly easy to integrate and make good choices for du Thus, we have TE at the end of our mnemonic. (We could just as easily have used ET at the end, since when these types of functions appear together it usually doesn't really matter which one is u and which one is du. ) Algebraic functions are generally easy both to integrate and to differentiate,and they come in the middle of the mnemonic

### EXAMPLE 3.2

### Using Integration by Parts Evaluate ∫(ln x)/x³ dx

Solution

Begin by rewriting the integral:

∫(ln x)/x³dx = ∫ x⁻³ln x dx.

Since this integral contains the algebraic function $x^{-3}$ and the logarithmic function ln x, choose u = ln x , since L comes before A in LIATE. After we have chosen u = ln x we must choose $dv=x^{-3}dx$

Next, since u = ln x , we have du=1/x dx . Also, v = x- dx = -x-2.Summarizing

u=lnx dv=x⁻³dx du=1/x dx v=∫x⁻³dx=-1/2x⁻²

Substituting into the integration-by-parts formula (Equation 3.1) gives

∫(ln x)/x³ dx = ∫ x⁻³ ln x dx = (ln x)(-1/2x⁻²) - ∫(-1/2x⁻²)(1/x) dx = -1/2x⁻² ln x + ∫ 1/2x⁻³ dx = -1/2x⁻² ln x - 1/4x⁻² + C = -1/(2x²)ln x - 1/(4x²) + C

 3 2 Ealuae / xlnx dx.

In some cases, as in the next two examples,it may be necessary to apply inteqration by parts more than once

### EXAMPLE 3.3

### Applying Integration by Parts More Than Once

Evaluate ∫ $x^2e^{3x}dx.$

## $②$ Solution

Using LIATE, choose $u=x^{2}$ and $dv=e^{3x}dx$ Thus, $du= 2x$ $dx$ and u=e3xdx =()e3x Therefore

u = x², dv = e^(3x)dx, du = 2x dx, v = (1/3)e^(3x)

Substituting into Equation 3.1 produces

∫x²e³ˣdx=(1/3)x²e³ˣ-∫(2/3)xe³ˣdx

We stil cannot itegratexe3 dx directly,but the integral nowhas a lower power on $X$ .We can evaluate this new integral by using integration by parts again. To do this, choose $u=x$ and du =2e3x dx.Thus, $du=dx$ and v=∫(2/3)e³ˣdx=(2/9)e³ˣ Nowe have

u=x, dv=(2/3)e³ˣdx, du=dx, v=(2/9)e³ˣ

Substituting back into the previous equation yields

∫ x²e³ˣ dx = (1/3)x²e³ˣ - ((2/9)xe³ˣ - ∫ (2/9)e³ˣ dx).

After evaluating the last integral and simplifying, we obtain

∫x²e³ˣdx = (1/3)x²e³ˣ - (2/9)xe³ˣ + (2/27)e³ˣ + C

## EXAMPLE 3.4

### Applying Integration by Parts When LIATE Doesn't Quite Work

Evaluate ∫ $t^3e^{t^2}dt.$

### $①$ Solution

If we use a strict interpretation of the mnemonic LIATE to make our choice of $u$ , we end up with $u=t^3$ and $dv=e^{t^2}dt$ Unfortuntely, hi choice wont work because we ae nal t evalatee ∫ ∫ ∫ $e^{t^2}dt.$ However sine e can evaluate te²dr, we can try choosing $u=t^{2}$ and $dv= te^{t^{2}}$ $dt.$ With these choices we have

u = t²; dv = teᵗ²dt; du = 2tdt; v = ∫teᵗ²dt = (1/2)eᵗ²

Thus, we obtain

∫ t³eᵗ² dt = (1/2)t²eᵗ² - ∫(1/2)eᵗ² 2t dt = (1/2)t²eᵗ² - (1/2)eᵗ² + C

## EXAMPLE 3.5

### Applying Integration by Parts More Than Once

Evaluate ∫ ∫sin(ln x)dx

### $②$ Solution

This integral appears to have only one function—namely, sinln x —however, we can always use the constant function 1 as the other function.In this example,let's choose u=sin(ln x) and $dv=|dx$ (The decision to use u=sin(ln x) is easy We can't choose dv = sin(ln x)dx because if we could integrate it, we wouldn't be using integration by parts in the first

place!) Consequently, $du=(1/x)$cos(ln x)dx and u = Idx = x. After applying integration by parts to the integral and simplifying, we have

∫sin(ln x)dx=xsin(ln x)-∫cos(ln x)dx

Unfortunately, this process leaves us with a new integral that is very similar to the original. However, let's see what happens when we apply integration by parts again. This time let's choose u = cos(ln x) and $dv=1dx$ ,making

du = -(1/x)sin(ln x)dx and v = ∫ $1dx= x.$ Substuting we have

∫sin(ln x)dx = xsin(ln x) - (xcos(ln x) - ∫-sin(ln x)dx)

After simplifying, we obtain

∫ sin(ln x)dx = x sin(ln x) - x cos(ln x) - ∫ sin(ln x)dx.

The last integral is now the same as the original. It may seem that we have simply gone in a circle, but now we car actual evaluateth integral Toseho t do this morecleary substute 
I=∫ ∫sin(ln x)dx Thus, te equatior becomes

I=xsin(ln x)-xcos(ln x)-I.

First, add $I$ to both sides of the equation to obtain

2I = xsin(ln x) - xcos(ln x)

Next, divide by 2:

I=(1/2)xsin(ln x)-(1/2)xcos(ln x)

Substituting I = ∫ I= 
I=∫ ∫sin(lnx)dx again, we hauve

∫sin(ln x)dx=(1/2)xsin(ln x)-(1/2)xcos(ln x)

From this we see that (1/2)xsin(ln x)-(1/2)xcos(ln x) is an antiderivative of sin(ln x)dx  For the most general antiderivative, add $+C$

∫ sin(ln x)dx=½xsin(ln x)-½xcos(ln x)+C

### $⑨$ Analysis If this method feels a little strange at first, we can check the answer by differentiation

d/dx((1/2)xsin(lnx)-(1/2)xcos(lnx)) = (1/2)sin(lnx)+(1/2)cos(lnx)-(1/2)cos(lnx)+(1/2)sin(lnx) = sin(lnx)

 3.3 Ealuate x²sinx dx

### Integration by Parts for Definite Integrals

Now that we have used integration by parts successfully to evaluate indefinite integrals, we turn our attention to definite integrals. The integration technique is really the same, only we add a step to evaluate the integral at the upper and lower limits of integration.

### Theorem 3.2

### Integration by Parts for Definite Integrals

Let $u=f(x)$ and $U=g(x)$ be functions with continuous derivatives on $[a,b]$ . Then

∫ₐᵇu dv = uv|ₐᵇ - ∫ₐᵇv du

### EXAMPLE 3.6

### Finding the Area of a Region

Find the area of the region bounded above by the graph of y=tan⁻¹x and below by the $x$ -axis over the interval [0,1]

Thi ngin on e e ∫₀¹arctan x $dx.$

### Solution

![](./images/fTI35BrI0g84DKpTOwlv0hdMt6g92AX40.png)
Figure 3.2 To find the area of the shaded region, we have to use integration by parts

For this integral, let's choose u=arctanx and $dv=dx$ ,thereby making du = 1/(x²+1)dx and $v=x$ .After applying the integration-by-parts formula (Equation 3.2) we obtain

Area = x tan⁻¹x|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x/(x²+1)dx

Use u-substitution to obtain

∫₀¹x/(x²+1)dx=(1/2)ln|x²+1|₀¹

Thus,

 Area = x arctan(x)|₀¹ - ½ln|x²+1|₀¹ = π/4 - ½ln2

At this point it might not be a bad idea to do a “reality check”on the reasonableness of our solution.Since π/4 - (1/2)ln2 ≈ 0.4388 , and from Figure 3.2 we expect our area to be slightly less than 0.5, this solution appears to be reasonable.

### EXAMPLE 3.7

### Finding a Volume of Revolution

Find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region bounded by the graph of $f(x)=e^{-x}$ ,the x-axis,the y-axis and the line $x=1$ about the y-axis.

### $②$ Solution

The best option to solving this problem is to use the shell method. Begin by sketching the region to be revolved, along with a typical rectangle (see the following graph).

![](./images/fADCqUdpbpUlYeCUxCmK0UZDBQOurVPoQ.png)

Fiqure 3.3 We can use the shell method to find a volume of revolution

To find thevolume using shlls we mus evaluate 2π∫₀¹ xe⁻ˣ dx To do this, let $u=x$ and $dv=e^{-x}$ . These choices eadl to $du=dx$ and v = ∫ $e^{- x}= - e^{- x}.$ Substituting into Equation 3.2, we obtain

Volume = 2π∫₀¹xe⁻ˣ dx = 2π(-xe⁻ˣ|₀¹ + ∫₀¹e⁻ˣ dx) = -2πxe⁻ˣ|₀¹ - 2πe⁻ˣ|₀¹ = 2π - 4π/e 

Analysis

Again, it is a good idea to check the reasonableness of our solution.We observe that the solid has a volume slightly less than that of a cylinder of radius 1 and height of 1/e added to the volume of a cone of base radius 1 and height of 1 - 1/e Consequently, the solid should have a volume a bit less than
π(1)²(1/e) + (π/3)(1)²(1-1/e) = 2π/(3e) + π/3 ≈ 1.8177

Since 2π-4π/e≈1.6603 ,we see that our calculated volume is reasonable

# 3.2 Trigonometric Integrals

### Learning Objectives 3.2.1Solve integration problems involving products and powers of sinx and cos.x.

3.2.2 Solve integration problems involving products and powers of tanx and secx. 3.2.3 Use reduction formulas to solve trigonometric integrals.

In this section we look at how to integrate a variety of products of trigonometric functions. These integrals are called trigonometric integrals. They are an important part of the integration technique called trigonometric substitution, which is featured in Trigonometric Substitution. This technique allows us to convert algebraic expressions that we may not be able to integrate into expressions involving trigonometric functions, which we may be able to integrate using the techniques described in this section. In addition, these types of integrals appear frequently when we study polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems later. Let's begin our study with products of. sin x and cos x.

## Integrating Products and Powers of sinx and cosx.

A key idea behind the strategy used to integrate combinations of products and powers of sin x and cos $x$ involves rewriting these expresions sums an diferencesof integralsof the formn ∫sinʲx cos x $dx$ or ∫cosʲx sin x  $dx.$ After rewriting these integrals, we evaluate them using u-substitution. Before describing the general process in detail, let's take a look at the following examples.

### EXAMPLE 3.8

### Solution Use $u$ substitution and let $u=$ Ⅱ= u=cos x .In this case, $du=$ -sin x dx.Thus,

∫cos³x sin x dx = -∫u³ du = -¼u⁴ + C = -¼cos⁴x + C

## EXAMPLE 3.9

### $①$ Solution To overt ti intl nral f the for ∫cosʲx sin x $dx$ rewrite sin³x = sin²x sin x and malke th sbstutor

sin²x = 1 - cos²x. Thus,
∫cos²xsin³x dx = ∫cos²x(1-cos²x)sinx dx = (1/5)cos⁵x - (1/3)cos³x + C

 3.6 Evaluate / cos"xsnxdx.

In the next example, we see the strategy that must be applied when there are only even powers of sin x and cos x. For integrals of this type, the identities

sin²x = 1/2 - 1/2cos(2x) = (1-cos(2x))/2

and

cos²x = 1/2 + 1/2cos(2x) = (1+cos(2x))/2

are invaluable.These identities are sometimes known as power-reducing identities and they may be derived from the double-angle identity cos(2x) = cos²x - sin²x and the Pythagorean identity cos²x+sin²x=1

### EXAMPLE 3.10

### Inteqrating an Even Power of sinx EValuate ∫sin²x $dx$

### To evaluate this integral, let's use the trigonometric identity sin²x=1/2-1/2cos(2x) Thus,

∫sin²x dx = ∫(1/2 - 1/2cos(2x))dx = x/2 - sin(2x)/4 + C

3.7 Evalae/ osxdx.

The general process for integrating products of powers of sin x and cos x is summarized in the following set of guidelines

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Integrating Products and Powers of sin x and cos x

To integrate ∫cosʲxsinᵏx $dx$ use th folowing trategies

1.If $k$ is odd, rewrite sinᵏx = sinᵏ⁻¹x sin x and use the identity sin²x = 1 - cos²x to rewrite sinᵏ⁻¹x in terms of cos x. Integrate using the substitution u=cos x This substitution makes du = -sin x $dx$ 2.If $j$ is odd, rewrite cos<sup>j</sup>x=cos<sup>j-1</sup>x cos x and use the identity cos²x = 1 - sin²x to rewrite $cos^{j-1}x$ in terms of sinx. Integrate using the substitution u=sin x This substitution makes $du=$ cos x dx. (Note: If both $j$ and $k$ are odd, either strategy 1 or strategy 2 may be used.) 3.If both $j$ and $k$ are even, use sin²x = (1/2) - (1/2)cos(2x) and cos²x=(1/2)+(1/2)cos(2x) After applying these formulas, simplify and reapply strategies 1 through 3 as appropriate.

### EXAMPLE 3.11

Integrating ∫cosʲxsinᵏx $dx$ where kis Od

Evaluate ∫cos⁸x sin⁵x $dx.$

### $②$ Solution

Since thepower on sin x is odd, use strategy 1. Thus
∫cos⁸xsin⁵x dx = ∫cos⁸xsin⁴xsinx dx = ∫cos⁸x(sin²x)²sinx dx = ∫cos⁸x(1-cos²x)²sinx dx = ∫u⁸(1-u²)²(-du) = ∫(-u⁸+2u¹⁰-u¹²)du = -u⁹/9+2u¹¹/11-u¹³/13+C = -cos⁹x/9+2cos¹¹x/11-cos¹³x/13+

Break off sinx. Rewrite sinx =(sin²x)² Substitute sin2x = 1 cos2 x Let u = cos x and du =-sin x dx. Expand. Evaluate the integral. Substitute u = cos x

### EXAMPLE 3.12

Integrating ∫cosʲxsinᵏx $dx$ Wwhere and j ae Even

Evaluate ∫sin⁴x $dx$

### $②$ Solution

Since the power on sin x is even k'=4 and the power on cos x is even $(j=0$ ),we must use strategy 3. Thus,

∫sin⁴x dx = ∫(sin²x)²dx = ∫(1/2 - 1/2cos(2x))²dx = ∫(1/4 - 1/2cos(2x) + 1/4cos²(2x))dx = ∫(1/4 - 1/2cos(2x) + 1/4(1/2 + 1/2cos(4x)))dx

Since cos²(2x) has an even power, substitute cos²(2x) = 1/2+1/2cos(4x)

∫(3/8 - 1/2cos(2x) + 1/8cos(4x))dx Simplify. = 3/8x - 1/4sin(2x) + 1/32sin(4x) + C Evaluate the integral.

 3. ealate cosx dx.

. Ealuae / os(xdx.

In some areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics, signal processing, and the computation of Fourier series, it is often necessary to integrate products that include sin(ax), sin(bx), cos(ax), and cos(bx) . These integrals are evaluated by applying trigonometric identities, as outlined in the following rule.

Rule: Inteqrating Products of Sines and Cosines of Different Anqles

To integrate products involving sin(ax), sin(bx), cos(ax) , and cos(bx), use the substitutions

sin(ax)sin(bx)=1/2cos((a-b)x)-1/2cos((a+b)x)

sin(ax)cos(bx)=1/2sin((a-b)x)+1/2sin((a+b)x)

cos(ax)cos(bx) = (1/2)cos((a - b)x) + (1/2)cos((a + b)x)

These formulas may be derived from the sum-of-angle formulas for sine and cosine

### EXAMPLE 3.13

Evaluating ∫sin(ax)cos(bx)dx

Evaluate ∫sin(5x)cos(3x)dx

Apply the identity sin(5x)cos(3x) = (1/2)sin(2x) + (1/2)sin(8x) Thus,

∫sin(5x)cos(3x)dx = ½∫sin(2x)dx + ½∫sin(8x)dx = -¼cos(2x) - ⅛cos(8x) + C

3.10Evaluate cos(6x)cos(5x)dx

### Integrating Products and Powers of tanx and secx

Before discussing the integration of products and powers of tanx and sec x,it is useful to recall the integrals involving tan x and sec $x$ we have already learned：

∫sec²x dx = tan x + C, ∫sec x tan x dx = sec x + C, ∫tan x dx = ln|sec x| + C, ∫sec x dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + C

You can read some interestinq information at this website (http://www.openstax.orq/l/20 intseccube) to learn abou a common integral involving the secant.

 3.1 Evaluate /tan?xse²x dx

We now take a look at the various strategies for integrating products and powers of sec .x and tan.x.

###  Problem-Solving Strategy

Integrating / tan* x secx dx

To integrate ∫tanᵏx secʲx $dx$ ,use the flwing strategies

1.If $j$ is even and j≥2, rewrite secʲx = secʲ⁻²x sec²x and use sec²x = tan²x + 1 to rewrite secʲ⁻²x in terms of

2.If $k$ is odd and j ≥ 1 , rewrite  tanᵏx secʲx = tanᵏ⁻¹x secʲ⁻¹x sec x tan x  and use tan²x=sec²x-1 to rewrite tan^(k-1)x in terms of sec.x. Let u=sec x and du = sec x tan x $dx.$ (Note: If $j$ is even and $k$ is odd,then either strategy 1 or strategy 2 may be used.)

tan x. Let u=tan x and du = sec²x $dx$ 3.If $k$ is odd where k ≥ 3 and $j=0$ ,rewrite tanᵏx = tanᵏ⁻²x tan²x = tanᵏ⁻²x(sec²x - 1) = tanᵏ⁻²x sec²x - tanᵏ⁻²x  It may be necessary to repeat this process on the tanᵏ⁻²x term. 4.If $k$ is even and $j$ is odd, then use tan²x=sec²x-1 to express tanᵏx in terms of sec x. Use integration by parts to integrate odd powers of sec x.

## EXAMPLE 3.15

Integrating ∫tanᵏx secʲx $dx$ when jis Even

Evaluate ∫tan⁶xsec⁴x $dx.$

### $②$ Solution

Since the power on sec x is even,rewrite sec⁴x=sec²xsec²x and use sec²x = tan²x + 1 to rewrite the first sec²x in terms of tanx. Thus,

∫tan⁶xsec⁴x dx = ∫tan⁶x(tan²x+1)sec²x dx = ∫u⁶(u²+1)du = ∫(u⁸+u⁶)du = (1/9)u⁹+(1/7)u⁷+C = (1/9)tan⁹x+(1/7)tan⁷x+C

## EXAMPLE 3.16

Integrating/tnkxsex dx when k is Od

Evaluate ∫ tan⁵x sec³x $dx.$

### $②$ Solution Since the power on tan x $x$ x is odd,begin by rewriting tan⁵xsec³x=tan⁴xsec²xsecxtanx. Thus

tan⁵xsec³x = tan⁴xsec²xsecxtanx. ∫tan⁵xsec³x dx = ∫(tan²x)²sec²xsecxtanx dx = ∫(sec²x-1)²sec²xsecxtanx dx = ∫(u²-1)²u²du = ∫(u⁶-2u⁴+u²)du = 1/7u⁷-2/5u⁵+1/3u³+C = 1/7sec⁷x-2/5sec⁵x+1/3sec³x+C.

Write tan⁴x=(tan²x)².
Use tan²x = sec²x -1. Let u = sec x and du = sec xtan x dx Expand. Integrate. Substitute secx = u

## EXAMPLE 3.17

Integratingtan* x dx where $k$ is Odd and k ≥ 3 Evalate ∫tan³x $dx$

### $②$ Solution

Begin by rewriting tan³x = tanx tan²x = tanx(sec²x - 1) = tanx sec²x - tanx Thus,
∫tan³x dx = ∫(tan x sec²x - tan x)dx = ∫tan x sec²x dx - ∫tan x dx = 1/2 tan²x - ln|sec x| + C.

For the first integral, use the substitution u= $u=$ u=tan x .For the second integral, use the formula

### EXAMPLE 3.18

Integrating / sce*x dx

 Integrate ∫sec³x $dx$

### $②$ Solution This integral requires integration by parts. To begin, let u=sec x and dv=sec²x dx. These choices make du=sec x tan x

and v=tanx .Thus,
∫sec³x dx = sec x tan x - ∫tan x sec x tan x dx = sec x tan x - ∫tan²x sec x dx = sec x tan x - ∫(sec²x - 1) sec x dx = sec x tan x + ∫sec x dx - ∫sec³x dx = sec x tan x + ln|sec x + tan x| - ∫sec³x dx

We now have

∫sec³x dx = sec x tan x + ln|sec x + tan x| - ∫sec³x dx.

Since th integral ∫sec³x $dx$ has reapeare n therighthand side we can sole for ∫sec³x $dx$ byadingit both sides. In doing so, we obtain

2∫sec³x dx = secx tanx + ln|secx + tanx|

Dividing by 2, we arrive at

∫sec³x dx = (1/2)sec x tan x + (1/2)ln|sec x + tan x| + C

 The first power reduction rule may be verified by applying integration by parts. The second may be verified by following the strategy outlined for integrating odd powersof tan x.

## 3.3 Trigonometric Substitution

Learning Objectives

3.3.1Solve integration problems involving the square root of a sum or difference of two squares.

In this section,we explore integrals containing expressions of the form √(a²-x²) √(a²+x²) and √(x²-a²) , where the values of α are positive. We have already encountered and evaluated integrals containing some expressions of this type but many still remain inaccessible.The technique of trigonometric substitution comes in very handy when evaluating these integrals. This technique uses substitution to rewrite these integrals as trigonometric integrals

Integrals Involving √(a²-x²)

Before developin a eneral trategy forintegrals cntaining √(a²-x²) consider th intgral ∫√(9-x²)dx. This integral cannot be evaluated using any of the techniques we have discussed so far. However, if we make the substitution x = 3sinθ ,we have $dx=3$ cos θdθ.After substituting into the integral,we have

∫√(9 - x²) dx = ∫ √(9 - (3sinθ)²) 3cosθ dθ

After simplifying, we have

∫√(9-x²)dx = ∫9√(1-sin²θ)cosθdθ.

Letting 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ ,wenow have

∫√(9-x²)dx=∫9√(cos²θ)cosθdθ.

Assuming that cos θ≥0 ,we have

∫ √(9-x²) dx = ∫ 9cos²θ dθ

At this point,we can evaluate the inteqral usinq the techniques developed forinteqrating powers and products of trigonometric functions. Before completing this example, let's take a look at the general theory behind this idea.

To evaluate integrals involving √(a²-x²) , we make the substitution x=asinθ and dx = acosθ .To see that this actually makes sense, consider the following argument: The domain of √(a²-x²) is $[-a,a]$ . Thus, -a≤x≤a Consequently, -1 ≤ x/a ≤ 1 .Since the range of sin x over [-π/2,π/2] is [-1, 1], there is a unique angle θ satisfying -π/2≤θ≤π/2 so that sinθ=x/a , or equivalently, so that x=asinθ .If we substitute x=asinθ into √(a²-x²) , we get

√(a²-x²) = √(a²-(asinθ)²)  Let x=asinθ where -π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Simp = √(a²-a²sin²θ) Factor out a². = √(a²(1-sin²θ)) Substitute 1-sin²x=cos²x. = √(a²cos²θ) Take the square root. = |a cosθ| = a cosθ.

Since cos θ ≥ 0 on -π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 and $a>0$ 
14. |a cos θ| = a cos θ .We can see, from this discussion, that by making the substitution x=asinθ , we are able to convert an integral involving a radical into an integral involving trigonometric functions. After we evaluate the integral, we can convert the solution back to an expression involving $X$ .To see how to do this, let's begin by assuming that $0<x<a$ In this case, 0<θ<π/2 . Since sinθ=x/a , we can draw the reference triangle in Figure 3.4 to assist in expressing the values of cos .θ , tanθ,and theremaining trigonometric functions in terms of $x$ It can be shown that this triangle actually produces the correct values of the trigonometric functions evaluated at θ for all θ satisfying -π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. It is useful to observe that the expression √(a²-x²) actually appears as the length of one side of the triangle. Last, should θ appear by itself, we use θ=sin⁻¹(x/a)

![](./images/fMKi9QamBsg0D5WUm7X7lDrNiZUV6ACV0.png)

Figure 3.4A reference triangle can help express the trigonometric functions evaluated at θ in terms of $X$

The essential part of this discussion is summarized in the following problem-solving strategy

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Integrating Expressions Involving √(a²-x²)

1.It is a good idea to make sure the integral cannot be evaluated easily in another way. For example, although this method can be apledto integrasof the form ∫1/√(a²-x²)dx, ∫x/√(a²-x²)dx and ∫x√(a²-x²)dx, they can each be integrated directly either by formula or by a simple u-substitution

 2. Make the substitution x=asinθ and dx = acos Ado. Note: This substitution yields √(a²-x²) = acosθ 3.Simplify the expression. 4. Evaluate the integral using techniques from the section on trigonometric integrals. 5.Use the reference triangle from Figure 3.4 to rewrite the result in terms of $x$ You may also need to use some trigonometric identities and the relationship θ=sin⁻¹(x/a)

The following example demonstrates the application of this problem-solving strategy

## EXAMPLE 3.21

### $②$ Solution

Begin by making the substitutions x = 3sinθ and $dx=3$ cos Ad0. Since sinθ = x/3 we can construct the reference triangle shown in the following figure.

Figure 3.5 A reference triangle can be constructed for Example 3.21

Thus,

### EXAMPLE 3.22

Integrating an Expression Involvinge √(a²-x²) Evalate ∫√(4-x²)/x dx

### $②$ Solution

First make the substitutions x=2sinθ and $dx=2$ cos θd0. Since sinθ=x/2, we can construct the reference triangle shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fsBYiGWdw8TloMElEPod8T1lUtlEgXCtb.png)

Figure 3.6 A reference triangle can be constructed for Example 3.22

Thus,

∫√(4-x²)/x dx = ∫√(4-(2sinθ)²)/(2sinθ) 2cosθ dθ = ∫(2cos²θ)/sinθ dθ = ∫2(1-sin²θ)/sinθ dθ = ∫(2cscθ - 2sinθ)dθ = 2ln|cscθ - cotθ| + 2cosθ + C = 2ln|2/x - √(4-x²)/x| + √(4-x²) + C

Substitute x=2sinθ and dx =2 cos0d0 Substitute cos θ = 1 - sin²θ and simplify. Substitute sin²θ =1 -cos²0 Separate the numerator, simplify, and use 
cscθ=1/sinθ Evaluate the integral Use the reference triangle to rewrite the expression in terms of $x$ and simplify.

In the next example, we see that we sometimes have a choice of methods.

Make the substitution Expand the expression
∫x³√(1-x²)dx = -(1/2)∫x²√(1-x²)(-2x dx) = -(1/2)∫(1-u)√u du = -(1/2)∫(u¹/² - u³/²)du = -(1/2)((2/3)u³/² - (2/5)u⁵/²) + C = -(1/3)(1-x²)³/² + (1/5)(1-x²)⁵/² + C.
Evaluate the integral Rewrite in terms of $X$

For integrals containing √(a² + x²) let's first consider the domain of this expression.Since √(a² + x²) is defined for all real values of $x$ we restrict our choice to those trigonometric functions that have a range of all real numbers. Thus, our choice is restricted to selecting either x=atanθ or x=acotθ Either of these substitutions would actually work, but the standard substitution is x=atanθ or, equivalently, tan θ=x/a . With this substitution, we make the assumption that -π/2 < θ < π/2 ,so that we also have θ = tan⁻¹(x/a) The procedure for using thissubstitution is outlined in the following problem-solving strategy.e

### EXAMPLE 3.24

# Integrating an Expression Involving √(a²+x²) Evaluae ∫dx/√(1+x²) and check th soutio by f rentitian

### $②$ Solution

Begin with the substitution x=tanθ and dx = sec²θ dθ Since tan θ = x ,draw the reference triangle in the following figure.

![](./images/ff4fOxhHrNgFlXw9WwG1belrOhRCTqGYr.png)

Figure 3.8 The reference triangle for Example 3.24

Thus,

Substitute x=tanθ and dx = sec²θ dθ This substitution makes √(1+x²)=secθ . Simplify Evaluate the integral.
∫dx/√(1+x²) = ln|√(1+x²) + x| + C
Use the reference triangle to express the result in terms of $x$

To check the solution, differentiate:

d/dx(ln|√(1+x²)+x|) = 1/(√(1+x²)+x)⋅(x/√(1+x²)+1) = 1/(√(1+x²)+x)⋅(x+√(1+x²))/√(1+x²) = 1/√(1+x²)

Since √(1+x²) + x > 0 for ll values of $x$ we could rewrite ln|√(1+x²)+x| + C = ln(√(1+x²)+x) + C if desirec

# EXAMPLE 3.25

Evaluating ∫dx/√(1 + x²) Using iferen sustution

Use the sustuton x = sinhθ to evaluate ∫dx/√(1 + x²)

### $②$ Solution Because sinh θ has a range of all real numbers, and 1 + sinh²θ = cosh²θ we may also use the substitution x = sinhθ to

evaluate this integral. In this case, dx = $dx=$ dx = coshθdθ . Consequently,

Substitute x = sinhθ and dx = $dx=$ dx = coshθdθ Substitute 1+sinh²θ = cosh²θ
√(cosh²θ) = |coshθ|
 |coshθ|=coshθ since cosh θ > 0  for all θ
∫dx/√(1+x²) = ∫coshθ/√(1+sinh²θ)dθ = ∫coshθ/√(cosh²θ)dθ = ∫coshθ/|coshθ|dθ = ∫dθ = θ+C = sinh⁻¹x+C
Simplify. Evaluate the integral Since x = sinhθ we know θ=sinh⁻¹x

### $①$ Analysis

This answer looks quite different from the answer obtained using the substitution x = tan θ. To see that the solutions are the same, set y = sinh⁻¹x Thus, sinh y = x .From this equation we obtain:

(e<sup>y</sup> - e<sup>-y</sup>)/2 = x

After multiplying both sides by $2e^{y}$ and rewriting, this equation becomes:

$$e^{2y}-2xe^{y}-1=0.$$

Use the quadraticequation to solvefor $e^{y}$


eʸ = (2x ± √(4x²+4))/2

Simplifying, we have:

eʸ = x ± √(x² + 1)

Since x-√(x²+1)<0 , it must be the case that eʸ = x + √(x² + 1) Thus

y=ln(x+√(x²+1))

Last, we obtain

sinh⁻¹x = ln(x + √(x² + 1))

After we make the final observation that, since x+√(x²+1)>0

ln(x+√(x²+1))=ln|√(1+x²)+x|

we see that the two different methods produced equivalent solutions

# EXAMPLE 3.26

### Finding an Arc Length Find the length of the curve $y=x^{2}$ over the interval [0,1/2]

### Solution

Because dy/dx=2x , the arc length is given by

∫₀¹⁄₂√(1+(2x)²)dx=∫₀¹⁄₂√(1+4x²)dx

To evaluate this integral, use the substitution x = (1/2)tanθ and dx=(1/2)sec²θ dθ .We also need to change the limits of integration. If $x=0$ ,then θ=0 and if x = 1/2 then θ=π/4 . Thus,

After substitution, √(1+4x²)=tanθ . Substitute 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ and simplify. We derived this integral in the previous section
∫₀¹⁄₂√(1+4x²)dx = ∫₀^π⁄₄√(1+tan²θ)(1/2)sec²θ dθ = (1/2)∫₀^π⁄₄sec³θ dθ = (1/4)(√2+ln(√2+1))
Evaluate and simplify.

# Integrating Expressions Involving √(x²-a²)

The domain of the expression √x2- a² is (-∞o,-aUa,+o）. Thus, either x ≤ -a or x≥a .Hence, x/a≤-1 or 
x/a ≥ 1 . Since these intervals correspond to the range of sec on the set [0, π/2) ∪ (π/2, π] it makes sense to use the substitution sec θ = x/a or, equivalently, x = a sec θ ,where 0 ≤ θ < π/2 or π/2 < θ ≤ π . The corresponding substitution for $dx$ is dx = a sec θ tan θ dθ. The procedure for using this substitution is outlined in the following problem-solving strategy

## 3.4 Partial Fractions

### Learning Objectives

3.4.1 Integrate a rational function using the method of partial fractions 3.4.2 Recoqnize simple linear factors in a rational function 3.4.3 Recoqnize repeated linear factors in a rational function 3.4.4 Recognize quadratic factors in a rational function

We have seen some techniques that allow us to integrate specific rational functions.For example,we know that

∫du/u=ln|u|+C and ∫du/(u²+a²)=(1/a)tan⁻¹(u/a)+C

However, we do not yet have a technique that allows us to tackle arbitrary quotients of this type. Thus, it is not immediatly obious hw to go about evaluating ∫3x/(x²-x-2)dx However, we know from matria previously developed that

∫(1/(x+1)+2/(x-2))dx=ln|x+1|+2ln|x-2|+C.

In fact, by getting a common denominator, we see that

1/(x+1) + 2/(x-2) = 3x/(x²-x-2)

Consequently,

∫3x/(x²-x-2)dx = ∫(1/(x+1) + 2/(x-2))dx.

In this section, we examine the method of partial fraction decomposition, which allows us to decompose rationa functions into sums of simpler, more easily integrated rational functions. Usinq this method, we can rewrite an. expression such as: 3x/(x²-x-2) as an expression such as 1/(x+1) + 2/(x-2)

Thekey to the method ofpartial fraction decomposition is being able to anticipate the form that the decomposition of a rational function will take.As we shall see, this form is both predictable and hiqhly dependent on the factorization of the denominator of the rational function. It is also extremely important to keep in mind that partial fraction decomposition

can be applied to a rational function P(x)/Q(x) only if deg(P(x))<deg(Q(x)) In the case when deg(P(x)) ≥ deg(Q(x)) weus frs peformlon diso torewrtetheauote tet P(x)/Q(x) in the torm A(x) + R(x)/Q(x) where deg(R(x))<deg(Q(x)) We then do a partia fraction decomposionon R(x)/Q(x) .The folowing example athough not requiring partial fraction decomposition, illustrates our approach to integrals of rational functions of the form ∫P(x)/Q(x)dx where deg(P(x)) ≥ deg(Q(x))

### EXAMPLE 3.28

Integrating ∫P(x)/Q(x)dx, where deg(P(x)) ≥ deg(Q(x)) Evalate ∫(x²+3x+5)/(x+1)dx

Since deg (x² + 3x + 5) ≥ deg(x + 1), we perform long division to obtain

(x²+3x+5)/(x+1) = x+2+3/(x+1).

Thus,

∫(x²+3x+5)/(x+1)dx = ∫(x+2+3/(x+1))dx = x²/2+2x+3ln|x+1|+C

EValuate ∫(x-3)/(x+2)dx.

T integrte ∫P(x)/Q(x)dx ,where deg (P(x)) < deg(Q(x)) we must beginb factoring $Q(x)$

### Nonrepeated Linear Factors

If $Q(x)$ can be factored as (a₁x + b₁)(a₂x + b₂) … (aₙx + bₙ) , where each linear factor is distinct, then it is possible to find constants $A_{1}$ A1 A2 $A_2$ A₁,A₂, … Aₙ An $A_n$ satisfying

P(x)/Q(x) = A₁/(a₁x+b₁) + A₂/(a₂x+b₂) + ... + A<sub>n</sub>/(a<sub>n</sub>x+b<sub>n</sub>)

The proof that such constants exist is beyond the scope of this course.

In this next example, we see how to use partial fractions to integrate a rational function of this type.

### EXAMPLE 3.29

### Partial Fractions with Nonrepeated Linear Factors Evaluate ∫(3x+2)/(x³-x²-2x)dx

### $②$ Solution Since deg(3x+2)<deg(x³-x²-2x), we begin by factoring the denominator of (3x+2)/(x³-x²-2x) We can see thar

$x^{3}-x^{2}-2x=x(x-2)(x+1)$ Thus, there are constants A, $B$ , and $C$ satisfying

(3x+2)/(x(x-2)(x+1)) = A/x + B/(x-2) + C/(x+1)

We must now find these constants. To do so, we begin by getting a common denominator on the right. Thus,

(3x+2)/(x(x-2)(x+1)) = (A(x-2)(x+1)+Bx(x+1)+Cx(x-2))/(x(x-2)(x+1)).

Now, we set the numerators equal to each other, obtaininc

3x+2=A(x-2)(x+1)+Bx(x+1)+Cx(x-2)

There are two different strateqies for finding the coefficients $A$ ， $B$ ,and $C.$ We refer to theseasthemethod ofequatinc coefficients and the method of strateaic substitution

Rule:Method of Equating Coefficients

Rewrite Equation 3.8 in the form

3x + 2 = (A+B+C)x² + (-A+B-2C)x + (-2A)

Equating coefficients produces the system of equations

A+B+C=0, -A+B-2C=3, -2A=2.

To solve this system,we first observe that -2A=2⇒A=-1 Substituting this value into the first two equations gives us the system

B+C=1, B-2C=2

Multiplying the second equation by -1 and adding the resulting equation to the first produces

$$-3C=1,$$

which in turn implies that 
C=-1/3 Substituting this value into the equation $B+C=1$ yields B=.Thus, solving these equations yields $A=-1$ ， B = 4/3 , and C=-1/3

It is important to note that the system produced by this method is consistent if and only if we have set up the decomposition correctly.If the system is inconsistent, there is an error in our decomposition

## Rule: Method of Strategic Substitution

The method of strategic substitution is based on the assumption that we have set up the decomposition correctly. If the decomposition is set up correctly,then there must be values of $A$ $B$ and $C$ that satisfy Equation 3.8 for all values of $x.$ That is, this equation must be true for any value of $X$ we care to substitute into it. Therefore, by choosing values of $x$ carefully and substituting them into the equation, we may find $A$ ,B, and $C$ easily. For example, if we substitute. $x=0$ ,the equation reduces to 2 = A(-2)(1) Solving for $A$ yields $A=-1$ . Next, by substituting $x=2$ the equatior reduces to 8 = B(2)(3) or equivalently $B=4/3$ Last, we substitute $x=-1$ into the equation and obtair $-1=C(-1)(-3)$ . Solving, we have C=-1/3

It is important to keep in mind that if we attempt to use this method with a decomposition that has not been set up correctly, we are still able to find values for the constants, but these constants are meaningless. If we do opt to use the method of strategic substitution, then it is a good idea to check the result by recombining the terms algebraically

Now that wehave the values of $A$ ， $B$ ,and $C$ , we rewrite the original inteqral:.

∫(3x+2)/(x³-x²-2x)dx=∫(-1/x+(4/3)/(x-2)-(1/3)/(x+1))dx

Evaluating the integral gives us

∫(3x+2)/(x³ - x² - 2x)dx = -ln|x| + (4/3)ln|x-2| - (1/3)ln|x+1| + C

In the next example, we integrate a rational function in which the degree of the numerator is not less than the degree of the denominator

### EXAMPLE 3.30

### Dividing before Applying Partial Fractions Evalate ∫(x²+3x+1)/(x²-4)dx

### $②$ Solution Since degree 2) e(x²+3x+1)≥degree$(x^2-4)$ ,we must perform long division of polynomials.This results in

(x²+3x+1)/(x²-4) = 1 + (3x+5)/(x²-4).

Next, we perform partial fraction decomposition on (3x+5)/(x²-4)=(3x+5)/((x+2)(x-2)) Wehave

(3x + 5)/((x - 2)(x + 2)) = A/(x - 2) + B/(x + 2)

Thus,


3x+5 = A(x+2) + B(x-2)

Solving for $A$ and $B$ using either method,we obtain $A=11/4$ and $B=1/4$

Rewriting the original integral, we have

∫(x²+3x+1)/(x²-4)dx = ∫(1 + (11/4)/(x-2) + (1/4)/(x+2))dx

Evaluating the integral produces

∫(x²+3x+1)/(x²-4)dx = x + (11/4)ln|x-2| + (1/4)ln|x+2| + C.

As we see in the next example, it may be possible to apply the technique of partial fraction decomposition to a nonrational function. The trick is to convert the nonrational function to a rational function through a substitution.

## EXAMPLE 3.31

### Applying Partial Fractions after a Substitution Evaluate ∫cos x/(sin²x−sin x)dx

### のSolution

Let's begin by letting u=sin x . Consequently, du = $du=$ du = cosxdx . After making these substitutions, we have

∫cos x/(sin²x-sin x)dx = ∫du/(u²-u) = ∫du/(u(u-1))

Applying partial fraction decomposition to $1/u(u-1)$ gives 1/(u(u-1))=-1/u+1/(u-1)

Thus,

∫cos x/(sin²x - sin x)dx = -ln|u| + ln|u-1| + C = -ln|sin x| + ln|sin x - 1| + C.

 3.18 Evaluate / (x+3+x2dx.

## Repeated Linear Factors

For some applications, we need to integrate rational expressions that have denominators with repeated linear factorsthat is, rational functions with at least one factor of the form (ax+b)'' ,where $n$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. If the denominator contains the repeated linear factor (ax+b)'' , then the decomposition must contain

A₁/(ax+b) + A₂/(ax+b)² + ... + Aₙ/(ax+b)ⁿ

As we see in our next example. the basic techniaue used for solving for the coefficients is the same. but it reauires more algebra to determine the numerators of the partial fractions

### EXAMPLE 3.32

### Partial Fractions with Repeated Linear Factors Evaluate ∫(x-2)/((2x-1)²(x-1))dx

### $②$ Solution

We have degree (x - 2)< degree ((2x - 1)²(x - 1)), so we can proceed with the decomposition.Since $(2x-1)^{2}$ is a repeated linear factor include A/(2x-1)+B/(2x-1)² in the decomposition. Thus

(x-2)/((2x-1)²(x-1))=A/(2x-1)+B/(2x-1)²+C/(x-1)

After getting a common denominator and equating the numerators, we have

x-2=A(2x-1)(x-1)+B(x-1)+C(2x-1)².

We then use the method of equating coefficients to find the values of $A$ $B$ ,and $C$

x-2=(2A+4C)x²+(-3A+B-4C)x+(A-B+C).

Equating coefficients yields $2A+4C=0,-3A+B-4C=1$ ,and $A-B+C=-2$ Solving this system yields $A=2$ $B=3$ , and $C=-1$

Alternatively, we can use the method of strategic substitution. In this case, substituting $x=1$ and $x=1/2$ into Equation 3.9 easily produces the values $B=3$ and $C=-1$ . At this point, it may seem that we have run out of good choices for $x$ however, since we already have values for $B$ and $C$ we can substitute in these values and choose any value for $x$ not previously used. The value $x=0$ is a good option. In this case, we obtain the equation -2=A(-1)(-1)+3(-1)+(-1)(-1)² or equivalently, $A=2$

Now that we have the values for $A$ $B$ ,and $C$ ,we rewrite the original integral and evaluate it
∫(x-2)/((2x-1)²(x-1))dx=∫(2/(2x-1)+3/(2x-1)²-1/(x-1))dx=ln|2x-1|-3/(2(2x-1))-ln|x-1|+C.

## The General Method

Now that we are beainning to get the idea of how the techniaue of partial fraction decomposition works.let's outline the basic method in the following problem-solving strategy.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Partial Fraction Decomposition

To decompose the rational function $P(x)/Q(x)$ ,use the following steps

1.Make sure that degree (P(x))< $(P(x))<$ (P(x))<degree(Q(x)) . If not, perform long division of polynomials 2.Factor $Q(x)$ into the product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors. An irreducible quadratic is a quadratic that has no real zeros 3.Assuming that ( deg(P(x)) < deg(Q(x)), the factors of $Q(x)$ determine the form of the decomposition of $P(x)/Q(x)$ a.If $Q(x)$ can be factored as (a₁x + b₁)(a₂x + b₂)...(aₙx + bₙ) , where each linear factor is distinct, then it is

possible to find constants A₁, A₂, … Aₙ satisfying
P(x)/Q(x) = A₁/(a₁x+b₁) + A₂/(a₂x+b₂) + … + Aₙ/(aₙx+bₙ)

A₁/(ax+b) + A₂/(ax+b)² + ... + Aₙ/(ax+b)ⁿ

b.If $Q(x)$ contains the repeated linear factor $(ax+b)^n$ ,then the decomposition must contair c.For each irreducible quadratic factor $ax^{2}+bx+c$ that $Q(x)$ contains, the decomposition must include
(Ax+B)/(ax²+bx+c).
d. For each repeated irreducible quadratic factor (ax²+bx+c)ⁿ, the decomposition must include
(A₁x+B₁)/(ax²+bx+c) + (A₂x+B₂)/(ax²+bx+c)² + … + (Aₙx+Bₙ)/(ax²+bx+c)ⁿ
e. After the appropriate decomposition is determined, solve for the constants f.Last, rewrite the integral in its decomposed form and evaluate it using previously developed techniques or integration formulas.

### Simple Quadratic Factors

Now let's look at integrating a rational expression in which the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor Recall that the quadratic ax²+bx+c is irreducible if $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ has no real zeros—that is, if $b^{2}-4ac<0$

### EXAMPLE 3.33

### Rational Expressions with an Irreducible Quadratic Factor Evaluate ∫(2x-3)/(x³+x)dx

## $②$ Solution Since deg(2x-3) < deg(x³+x) , factor the denominator and proceed with partial fraction decomposition. Since.

$x^{3}+x=x(x^{2}+1)$ contains the irreducible quadratic factor $x^2+1$ , include (Ax+B)/(x²+1) as part of the decomposition, along with C/x for the linear term $x$ .Thus, the decomposition has the form

(2x-3)/(x(x²+1))=(Ax+B)/(x²+1)+C/x.

After getting a common denominator and equating the numerators, we obtain the equation

2x-3=(Ax+B)x+C(x²+1).

Solving for A $A$ $A,B$ B $B$ and $C$ , we get $A=3$ ， $B=2$ ,and $C=-3$

Thus,

(2x-3)/(x³+x) = (3x+2)/(x²+1) - 3/x

Substituting back into the inteqral, we obtain
∫(2x-3)/(x³+x)dx = ∫((3x+2)/(x²+1) - 3/x)dx = (3/2)ln|x²+1| + 2tan⁻¹x - 3ln|x| + C

Note:We may rewrite ln|x² + 1| = ln(x² + 1) if we wish to do so, since $x^{2}+1>0$

### EXAMPLE 3.34

### Partial Fractions with an Irreducible Quadratic Factor Evaluate ∫dx/(x³-8)

### $②$ Solution We can start by factoring $x^{3}-8=(x-2)(x^{2}+2x+4)$ . We see that the quadratic factor $x^{2}+2x+4$ is irreducible since

 2²-4(1)(4)=-12<0  .Using the decomposition described in the problem-solving strategy, we get

1/((x-2)(x²+2x+4))=A/(x-2)+(Bx+C)/(x²+2x+4)

After obtaining a common denominator and equating the numerators, this becomes

1=A(x²+2x+4)+(Bx+C)(x-2).

Applying either method, we get A=1/12, B=-1/12 , and C=-1/3

Rewrtig ∫dx/(x³-8) wehave

∫dx/(x³-8) = 1/12∫dx/(x-2) - 1/12∫(x+4)dx/(x²+2x+4)

We can see that

∫1/(x-2)dx = ln|x-2| + C, but ∫(x+4)/(x²+2x+4)dx requires a btmorefort ets egi y comleting hesqguare on $x^{2}+2x+4$ to obtain

$$x^{2}+2x+4=(x+1)^{2}+3.$$

By letting $u=x+1$ and consequently $du=dx$ we see that
∫(x+4)/(x²+2x+4)dx = ∫(x+4)/((x+1)²+3)dx = ∫(u+3)/(u²+3)du = ∫u/(u²+3)du + ∫3/(u²+3)du = (1/2)ln|u²+3| + √3tan⁻¹(u/√3) + C = (1/2)ln|x²+2x+4| + √3tan⁻¹((x+1)/√3) + C

Complete the square on the denominator. Substitute $u=x+1,x=u-1$ and $du=dx$ Split the numerator apart. Evaluate each integral Rewrite in terms of X and simplify.

Substituting back into the original integral and simplifying gives

∫dx/(x³-8)=(1/12)ln|x-2|-(1/24)ln|x²+2x+4|-(√3/12)tan⁻¹((x+1)/√3)+C

Here again, we can drop the absolute value if we wish to do so, since $x^{2}+2x+4>0$ for all $x$

### $②$ Solution

Let's begin by sketching the region to be revolved (see Eiqure 3.11). From the sketch, we see that the shell method is a good choice for solving this problem

![](./images/fy3SBg9YVYx7xlcDVotfKbFunV14vwaFt.png)

Figure 3.11 We can use the shell method to find the volume of revolution obtained by revolving the region shown about the y-axis.

The volume is given by

V=2π∫₀¹x⋅x²/(x²+1)²dx=2π∫₀¹x³/(x²+1)²dx

Since deg((x²+1)²)=4>3=deg(x³), we can proceed with partial fraction decomposition. Note that (x²+1)² is a repeated irreducible quadratic. Using the decomposition described in the problem-solving strategy, we get

x³/(x²+1)²=(Ax+B)/(x²+1)+(Cx+D)/(x²+1)².

Finding a common denominator and equating the numeratorsgives

x³ = (Ax+B)(x²+1) + Cx + D

Solving, we obtain $A=1$ $B=0$ $C=-1$ ,and $D=0$ Substituting back into the integral, we have

V = 2π∫₀¹ x³/(x²+1)² dx = 2π∫₀¹ (x/(x²+1) - x/(x²+1)²) dx = 2π(1/2 ln(x²+1) + 1/(2(x²+1)))|₀¹ = π(ln2 - 1/2).

# 3.5 Other Strategies for Integration

### Learning Objectives

3.5.1 Use a table of integrals to solve integration problems. 3.5.2 Use a computer algebra system (CAS) to solve integration problems.

In addition to the techniques of integration we have already seen, several other tools are widely available to assist with the process of integration.Among these tools are integration tables, which are readily available in many books including the appendices to this one.Also widely available are computer algebra systems (CAs), which are found on calculators and in many campus computer labs, and are free online.

## Tables of Integrals

Integration tables, if used in the right manner, can be a handy way either to evaluate or check an integral quickly. Keep ir mind that when using a table to check an answer, it is possible for two completely correct solutions to look very different. For example, in Trigonometric Substitution, we found that, by using the substitution. x = tan6 ,we can arrive at

∫dx/√(1+x²)=ln(x+√(x²+1))+C

However, using x = sinhθ , we obtained a different solution-namely

∫dx/√(1 + x²) = sinh⁻¹x + C

Welater showed algebraically that the two solutions are equivalent.That is,we showed that sinh⁻¹x = ln(x + √(x²+1)) In this case, the two antiderivatives that we found were actually equal. This need not be the case.However, as lonq as the difference in the two antiderivatives is a constant, they are equivalent

### EXAMPLE 3.36

### Using a Formula from a Table to Evaluate an Integral Use the table formula

∫√(a²-u²)/u²du=-√(a²-u²)/u-sin⁻¹(u/a)+C

t valate ∫√(16-e²ˣ)/eˣ dx

### $①$ Solution

If we look at integration tables, we see that several formulas contain expressions of the form √(a²-u²) This expression is actually similar to √(16 - e²ˣ) ,where $a=4$ and $u=e^{X}$ . Keep in mind that we must also have $du=e^{x}$ dx. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the given integral by $e^{X}$ should help to put this integral in a useful form. Thus, we now have

∫√(16-e²ˣ)/eˣ dx=∫√(16-e²ˣ)/e²ˣ eˣ dx

Sustuting $u=e^{X}$ and $du=e^{X}$ ds prouces ∫√(a²-u²)/u²du From theinegrato tableta in pendiAli

∫√(a²-u²)/u² du = -√(a²-u²)/u - sin⁻¹(u/a) + C

Thus,

∫(√(16-e²ˣ)/eˣ)dx = ∫(√(16-e²ˣ)/e²ˣ)eˣ dx = ∫(√(16-u²)/u²)du = -√(16-u²)/u - sin⁻¹(u/4) + C = -√(16-e²ˣ)/eˣ - sin⁻¹(eˣ/4) + C

### Computer Algebra Systems

If available, a CAS is a faster alternative to a table for solving an integration problem. Many such systems are widely available and are, in general, quite easy to use.

### EXAMPLE 3.37

### Usinq a Computer Algebra System to Evaluate an Integra Us acomputeralebra syse to evalate ∫dx/√(x²-4) Compare hisresut with 
ln|√(x²-4)/2 + x/2| + C, aresut we

might have obtained if we had used triqonometric substitution

### $②$ Solution

Using Wolfram Alpha,we obtain

∫dx/√(x²-4)=ln|√(x²-4)+x|+C

Notice that

ln|√(x² - 4)/2 + x/2| + C = ln|√(x² - 4) + x|/2 + C = ln|√(x² - 4) + x| - ln 2 + C

Since these two antiderivatives differ by only a constant, the solutions are equivalent.We could have also demonstrated that each of these antiderivatives is correct by differentiating them

### MEDIA

You can access an integral calculator (http://www.openstax.org/l/2o intcalc) for more examples

### EXAMPLE 3.38

### Using a CAS to Evaluate anIntegral

Evalate ∫ ∫sin³x dx sing a CS comprethe eu o (1/3)cos³x - cos x + C te eut ig ae tae using the technique for integrating odd powers of sin x discussed earlier in this chapter

Using Wolfram Alpha, we obtain

∫sin³x dx = (1/12)(cos(3x) - 9cos(x)) + C

This looks quite different from (1/3)cos³x - cos x + C To see that these antiderivatives are equivalent, we can make use of a few trigonometric identities:

1/12(cos(3x)-9cos(x)) = 1/3cos³x - cosx

Thus, the two antiderivatives are identical.

We may also use a CAS to compare the qraphs of the two functions,as shown in the followinq fiqure

# 3.6 Numerical Integration

## Learning Objectives

3.6.1Approximate the value of a definite integral by using the midpoint and trapezoidal rules 3.6.2 Determine the absolute and relative error in using a numerical integration technique

3.6.3 Estimate the absolute and relative error using an error-bound formula 3.6.4 Recognize when the midpoint and trapezoidal rules over-or underestimate the true value of an integral. 3.6.5 Use Simpson's rule to approximate the value of a definite integral to a given accuracy

The antiderivatives of many functions either cannot be expressed or cannot be expressed easily in closed form (that is, in terms of known functions). Consequently, rather than evaluate definite integrals of these functions directly, we resort to various techniques of numerical integration to approximate their values.In thissection we explore several of these techniques. In addition, we examine the process of estimating the error in using these techniques

## The Midpoint Rule.

Earlier in this text we defined the definite inteqral of a function over an interval as the limit of Riemann sums.In qeneral any iean sum of functon $f(x)$ over aniteral $[a,b]$ may vewedas an stimate f ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx Recal hat a Riemann sum of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$ is obtained by selecting a partition

P = {x₀, x₁, x₂, …, xₙ} ,where a=x₀<x₁<x₂<…<xₙ=b

and a set

S = {x₁*, x₂*, …, xₙ*} ，where  xᵢ₋₁ ≤ xᵢ* ≤ xᵢ for all i.

The Riemann sum corresponding to the partition $P$ and the set S is given by f(x)xi, where Δxᵢ=xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁ the length of the ith subinterval.

The midpoint rule for estimating a definite integral uses a Riemann sum with subintervals of equal width and the midpoints, $m_i$ , of each subinterval in place of $x_{i}^{*}$ .Formally, we state a theoremregarding the convergence of the midpoint rule as follows.

### Theorem 3.3

### The Midpoint Rule

Assume that $f(x)$ is continuous on $[ a, b]$ . Let n be a positive integer and Δx = (b - a)/n If $[a,b]$ is divided into $n$ subintervals, each of length Δx, and $m_{i}$ is the midpoint of the ith subinterval, set

Mₙ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(mᵢ)Δx.

lim(n→∞)Mₙ=∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

As we can seein Figure313 f f(x) ≥ 0 over $[a,b]$ .then ∑_(i=1)^n f(mᵢ)Δx corresponds to the sum of the areas o rectangles approximating the areabetween the graph of $f(x)$ and the x-axis over $[a,b].$ The graph shows the rectangles corresponding to $M_{4}$ for a nonnegative function over a closed interval $[a,b]$

![](./images/fA3T8fzHWm66SMFIARWkk6Gd4lRRgslDp.png)

Figure 3.13 The midpoint rule approximates the area between the graph of $f(x)$ and the x-axis by summing the areas of rectangles with midpoints that are points on $f(x)$

## EXAMPLE 3.39

### Using the Midpoint Rule with $M_4$ Use te midpon rl t estimate ∫₀¹x²dx using ou subinterais cempare te ru ith he atal gle o i

 integral.

### $②$ Solution

Each subinterval has length Δx = (1-0)/4 = 1/4 .Therefore, the subintervals consist o

[0,1/4],[1/4,1/2],[1/2,3/4],and[3/4,1].

The midpoints of these subintervals are {1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8}. Thus,

M₄ = (1/4)f(1/8) + (1/4)f(3/8) + (1/4)f(5/8) + (1/4)f(7/8) = (1/4)(1/64) + (1/4)(9/64) + (1/4)(25/64) + (1/4)(49/64) = 21/64.

Since

∫₀¹x²dx = ⅓ and |⅓ - 21/64| = 1/192 ≈ 0.0052

we see that the midpoint rule produces an estimate that is somewhat close to the actualvalue of the definite intearal

### EXAMPLE 3.40

### Using the Midpoint Rule with $M_{6}$ Use $M_{6}$ to estimate the length of the curve y=x²/2 on [1,4]

![](./images/futBxYbzvIoq8VucQe9MwwcHG4HYReGP2.png)

### Solution

The length of y=x²/2 on [1, 4] is

∫₁⁴√(1+(dy/dx)²)dx. becomes ∫₁⁴√(1+x²)dx.

Since dy/dx=x

If [1,4] is divided into six subintervals, then each subinterval has length Δx = (4-1)/6 = 1/2 and the midpoints of the subintervals are  {5/4, 7/4, 9/4}  ,,}.Ifwe set f(x)=√(1+x²)

M₆ = ½f(5/4) + ½f(7/4) + ½f(9/4) + ½f(11/4) + ½f(13/4) + ½f(15/4) ≈ ½(1.6008 + 2.0156 + 2.4622 + 2.9262 + 3.4004 + 3.8810) = 8.1431.

## The Trapezoidal Rule

We can also approximate the value of a definite integral by using trapezoids rather than rectangles. In Figure 3.14, the area beneath the curve is approximated by trapezoids rather than by rectangles.

![](./images/fZm0IaoZTgBkn260C69vxkKXYAQorbhM9.png)

Fiqure3.14 Trapezoids may be used to approximate the areaunder a curve,hence approximating the definite inteqral

The trapezoidal rule for estimating definite integrals uses trapezoids rather than rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. To gain insight into the final form of the rule, consider the trapezoids shown in Figure 3.14. We assume that the length of each subinterval is given by. Δx .First,recall that the areaof a trapezoidwithaheight of $h$ and bases of length $b_1$ and $b_2$ is given by Area (1/2)h(b₁+b₂) . We see that the first trapezoid has a height Δx and parallel bases of

length $f(x_0)$ and f(x<sub>l</sub>) Thus, the area of the first trapezoid in Figure 3.14 is

1/2Δx(f(x₀) + f(x₁))

The areas of the remaining three trapezoids are

(1/2)Δx(f(x₁) + f(x₂)), (1/2)Δx(f(x₂) + f(x₃)), and (1/2)Δx(f(x₃) + f(x₄)).

Consequently,

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≈½Δx(f(x₀)+f(x₁))+½Δx(f(x₁)+f(x₂))+½Δx(f(x₂)+f(x₃))+½Δx(f(x₃)+f(x₃))

After taking out a common factor of (1/2)Δx and combining like terms, we have

∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx ≈ (1/2)Δx(f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 2f(x₃) + f(x₄))

Generalizing, we formally state the following rule.

### Theorem 3.4

### The Trapezoidal Rule

Assume that $f(x)$ is continuous over $[a,b]$ . Let n be a positive integer and Δx=(b-a)/n. Let $[a,b]$ be divided into n subintervals, each of length Δx , with endpoints at P={x₀,x₁,x₂, …, xₙ}. Set

Γₙ = (1/2)Δx(f(x₀)+2f(x₁)+2f(x₂)+…+2f(xₙ₋₁)+f(xₙ)); limₙ→₊∞ Tₙ = ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx

Before continuing. let's make a few observations about the trapezoidal rule.First of all. it is useful to note that
Tn = ½(Ln + Rn) where Ln = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ₋₁)Δx and Rn = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx

That is, $L_{n}$ and $R_{r}$ approximate the integral using the left-hand and right-hand endpoints of each subinterval, respectively. In addition, a careful examination of Figure 3.15 leads us to make the following observations about using the trapezoidal rules and midpoint rules to estimate the definite integral of a nonnegative function. The trapezoidal rule tends to overestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave up and to underestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave down. On the other hand, the midpoint rule tends to average out these errors somewhat by partially overestimating and partially underestimating the value of the definite integral over these same types of intervals. This leads us to hypothesize that, in general, the midpoint rule tends to be more accurate than the trapezoidal rule.

Figure 3.15 The trapezoidal rule tends to be less accurate than the midpoint rule

## EXAMPLE 3.41

### Using the Trapezoidal Rule Us the trapezodl rul t estimate ∫₀¹x²dx using fou subintersls

### $②$ Solution The endpoints of the subintervalsconsist of elments of theset P = {0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1} and Δx = (1-0)/4 = 1/4 . Thus,

∫₀¹x²dx ≈ 1/2·1/4(f(0)+2f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+2f(3/4)+f(1)) = 1/8(0+2·1/16+2·1/4+2·9/16+1) = 11/32.

### Absolute and Relative Error

An important aspect of using these numerical approximation rules consists of calculating the error in using them for estimating the value of a definite integral. We first need to define absolute error and relative error.

### Definition

If $B$ is our estimate of some quantity having an actual value of A, then the absolute error is given by |A - B| The relative error is the error as a percentage of the absolute value and is given by |(A-B)/A| = |(A-B)/A|·100%

The calculated value is ∫₀¹x²dx=1/3 and our estimate rom the exampl is M₄ = 21/64 Thus the absolute error is giver by 
|(1/3)-(21/64)| = 1/192 ≈ 0.0052 . The relative error is

In the two previous examples,we were able to compare our estimate of an inteqral with the actual value of the inteqral however, we do not typically have this luxury. In general, if we are approximating an integral, we are doing so because we cannot compute the exact value of the integral itself easily. Therefore, it is often helpful to be able to determine an upper bound for the error in an approximation of an integral. The following theorem provides error bounds for the midpoint and trapezoidal rules. The theorem is stated without proof

### Theorem 3.5

### Error Bounds for the Midpoint and Trapezoidal Rules

Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function over $[a,b]$ ,having a second derivative f'(x) over this interval. If M is the maximum value of |f<sup>σ</sup>(x)| over $[a,b].$ then the upper bounds for the error in using $M_n$ and $T_{n}$ to estimate

![](./images/feICOnbUrG7r1MpabcLU1S55f6m6OTCh0.png)

Error in Mₙ ≤ M(b-a)³/24n²

and

Error in Tₙ ≤ M(b-a)³/12n².

We can use these bounds to determine the valueof $n$ necessary to guarantee that the error in an estimate is less than a specified value.

midpoint rule?

### $②$ Solution

We beqin by determining the value of $M$ , the maximum value of |f''(x)| over [0,1] for fx)= ex.Sinc f'(x)=2xeˣ² ,we have

$$f^{''}(x)=2e^{x^{2}}+4x^{2}e^{x^{2}}.$$

Thus,

|f''(x)| = 2eˣ²(1+2x²) ≤ 6e.

From the error-bound Equation 3.12, we have

Error in Mₙ≤M(b-a)³/24n²≤6e(1-0)³/24n²=6e/24n²

Now wesolve the following inequality for $n$

6e/(24n²) ≤ 0.01

Thus, n 600e 8.24. Since $n$ must be an integer satisfying this inequality, a choiceoff $n=9$ would guarantee that |∫₀¹eˣ²dx - Mₙ| < 0.01

### ® Analysis

We might havebeen tempted to round 8.24 down and choose $n=8$ , but this would be incorrect because we must have an integer greater than or equal to 8.24.We need to keep in mind that the error estimates provide an upper bound only for the error The actual estimate may, in fact, be a much better approximation than is indicated by the error bound

# Simpson's Rule

With the midpoint rule, we estimated areas of regions under curves by using rectangles. In a sense, we approximated the curve with piecewise constant functions.With the trapezoidal rule, we approximated the curve by using piecewise linear functions. What if we were, instead, to approximate a curve using piecewise quadratic functions? with Simpson's Fadesee ∫ₓ₀ˣ²f(x)dx ∫_{x₀}^{x₂}p(x)dx Are p(x)=Ax²+Bx+C Eete function passing through $(x_{0},f(x_{0}))$ $(x_{1},f(x_{1}))$ , and $(x_{2},f(x_{2}))$ (Figure 3.16).

This process is continued with each successive pair of subintervals.

![](./images/fILwrlvg5R6UvPfmxzR0asvML4f1qVvh3.png)
Figure 3.16 With Simpson's rule, we approximate a definite integral by integrating a piecewise quadratic function.

To understand the formula that we obtain for Simpson's rule,we beqin by deriving a formula for this approximation over the first two subintervals.As we qo throuqh the derivation,we need tokeep in mind the following relationships

f(x₀)=p(x₀)=Ax₀²+Bx₀+C
f(x₁)=p(x₁)=Ax₁²+Bx₁+C
f(x₂)=p(x₂)=Ax₂²+Bx₂+C

x₂-x₀=2Δx ,where Δx is the length of a subinterval.

x₂ + x₀ = 2x₁, since x₁ = (x₂ + x₀)/2.

Thus,

Find the antiderivative Evaluate the antiderivative.
∫ₓ₀ˣ²f(x)dx ≈ ∫ₓ₀ˣ²(Ax²+Bx+C)dx = A/3x³+B/2x²+Cx|ₓ₀ˣ₂ = A/3(x₂³-x₀³)+B/2(x₂²-x₀²)+C(x₂-x₀) = A/3(x₂-x₀)(x₂²+x₂x₀+x₀²)+B/2(x₂-x₀)(x₂+x₀)+C(x₂-x₀) = (x₂-x₀)/6(2A(x₂²+x₂x₀+x₀²)+3B(x₂+x₀)+6C) = Δx/3((Ax₂²+Bx₂+C)+(Ax₀²+Bx₀+C)+A(x₂²+2x₂x₀+x₀²)+2B(x₂+x₀)+4C) = Δx/3(f(x₂)+f(x₀)+A(x₂+x₀)²+2B(x₂+x₀)+4C)
Factor out (x₂-x₀)/6 Rearrange the terms Factor and substitute
1 uctor uilu vuviutusc. f(x₂)=Ax₂²+Bx₂+C and f(x₀)=Ax₀²+Bx₀+C. Substitute x₂+x₀=2x₁.


Δx/3(f(x₂) + f(x₀) + A(2x₁)² + 2B(2x₁) + 4C) = Δx/3(f(x₂) + 4f(x₁) + f(x₀))
Expand and substitute
f̂(x₁)=Ax₁²+Bx₁+C
If weaproximate ∫ₓ₂ˣ₄f(x)dx usig th same method wese thtwehave

∫ₓ₀ˣ₄f(x)dx≈(Δx/3)(f(x₄)+4f(x₃)+f(x₂))

Combining these two approximations, we get

∫ₓ₀ˣ⁴f(x)dx=(Δx/3)(f(x₀)+4f(x₁)+2f(x₂)+4f(x₃)+f(x₄)).

The pattern continues as we add pairs of subintervals to our approximation. The general rule may be stated as follows.

### Theorem 3.6

### Simpson's Rule

Assume that $f(x)$ is continuous over $[a,b].$ Let n be a positive even integer and Δx=(b-a)/n. Let $[a,b]$ be divided into n subintervals, each of length .x, with endpoints at P={x₀,x₁,x₂, …, xₙ}. Set

Sₙ = (Δx/3)(f(x₀) + 4f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 4f(x₃) + 2f(x₄) + ... + 2f(xₙ₋₂) + 4f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ))

Then,

lim_{n→+∞} Sₙ = ∫_{a}^{b}f(x)dx

Just as the trapezoidal rule is the average of the left-hand and right-hand rules for estimating definite integrals, Simpson's rule may be obtained from the midpoint and trapezoidal rules by using a weiqhted averaqe.It can be showr that S_(2n)=(2/3)M_n+(1/3)T_n

It is also possible to put a bound on the error when using Simpson's rule to approximate a definite integral. The bound in the error is given by the following rule

### Rule: Error Bound for Simpson's Rule

Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function over $[a,b]$ having a fourth derivative, $f^{(4)}(x)$ , over this interval. If $M$ is the maximum value of |f⁽⁴⁾(x)|  over $[a,b]$ ,then theupper bound forthe error inusing $S_{n}$ to estimate / f (x)dx i given by


Error in Sₙ ≤ M(b-a)⁵/(180n⁴)

## EXAMPLE 3.45

### Applying Simpson's Rule 1 Use $S_2$ to approximate ∫₀¹x³dx Estimate a bound fortherorin $S_{2}$

### $②$ Solution

Since [0, 1] is divided into two intervals, each subinterval has length Δx = (1-0)/2 = 1/2 .The endpoints of these subintervals are {0,1/2,1}. If we set f(x) = x³ , then

S₄ = (1/3)(1/2)(f(0) + 4f(1/2) + f(1)) = (1/6)(0 + 4(1/8) + 1) = 1/4.

Error in S₂ ≤ 0(1)⁵/(180⋅2⁴) = 0

This bound indicates that the value obtained through Simpson's rule is exact. A quick check will verify that, in fact
∫₀¹x³dx=¼

### EXAMPLE 3.46

### Applying Simpson's Rule 2 Use $S_{6}$ to estimate the length of the curve y=x²/2 over [1, 4].

### $②$ Solution

The length of y=x²/2 over [1,4] is I + x dx.I we divide[1, 4] into ix subintervals, then each subinterval has length Δx = (4-1)/6 = 1/2 , and the endpoints of the subintervals are {1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, 3, 7/2, 4}. Setting f(x)=√(1+x²)

S₆ = (1/3)(1/2)[f(1) + 4f(3/2) + 2f(2) + 4f(5/2) + 2f(3) + 4f(7/2) + f(4)]

After substituting, we have

S₆=(1/6)(1.4142+4⋅1.80278+2⋅2.23607+4⋅2.69258+2⋅3.16228+4⋅3.64005+4.12311)≈8.14594.

Learning Objectives 3.7.1 Evaluate an integral over an infinite interval.

3.7.2 Evaluate an integral over a closed interval with an infinite discontinuity within the interval 3.7.3Use the comparison theorem to determine whether a definite integral is convergent

Is the area between the graph of f(x) = 1/x and the x-axis over the interval [1,+∞) finite or infinite? If this same region is revolved about the x-axis, is the volume finite or infinite? Surprisingly, the area of the region described is infinite, but the volume of the solid obtained by revolving this region about the $x-$ axis is finite

In this section, we define inteqrals over an infinite interval as well as integrals of functions containing a discontinuity on the interval. Inteqrals of these types are called improper inteqrals. We examine several techniques for evaluating. improper integrals,all of which involve taking limits.

### Integrating over an Infinite Interval

How shuid we go abou definingan iteralothetype ∫ₐ⁺∞f(x)dx? We can integrate ∫_a^t f(x) $dx$ forany vlue of 1, so it is reasonable to look at the behavior of this integral as we substitute larger values of $t.$ Figure 3.17shows that ∫ₐᵗf(x) $dx$ may be interte as area fo various values of $t$ I ther word, ay ee an mproe intalasa limit, taken as one of the limits of integration increases or decreases without bound.

Figure 3.17 To integrate a function over an infinite interval, we consider the limit of the integral as the upper limit increases without bound

### Definition

1.Let $f(x)$ be continuous over an interval of the form [a,+∞) .Ther

2. Let $f(x)$ be continuous over an interval of the form (-∞,b] . Ther

provided this limit exists.

In each case, if the limit exists, then the improper inteqral is said to converge. If the limit does not exist, ther the improper integral is said to diverge

3.Let $f(x)$ be continuous over (-∞,+∞) .Then

In our first example, we return to the question we posed at the start of this section: Is the area between the graph of f(x) = 1/x and the $x$ -axis over the interval [1,+∞) finite or infinite?

# EXAMPLE 3.47

### Finding anArea

Determine whether the area between the graph of f(x) = 1/x and the x-axis over the interval [1,+∞) is finite or infinite.

We first do a quick sketch of the region in question, as shown in the following graph

Since the improper integral diverges to +∞ , the area of the region is infinite.

The improper integral converges to π . Therefore, the volume of the solid of revolution is π

In conclusion,although the areaof the regionbetween the x-axis and the graph of $f(x)=1/x$ Over the interval [1,+∞) is infinite, the volume of the solid generated by revolving this region about the X-axis is finite. The solid generated is known as Gabriel's Horn

# EXAMPLE 3.49

Chapter Opener: Traffic Accidents in a City

![](./images/fm4ImwtmM2kwK6Ln6I0QHNZdZC6DQM27d.png)

Figure 3.20 (credit: modification of work by David McKelvey,Flickr)

In the chapter opener, we stated the following problem: Suppose that at a busy intersection, traffic accidents occur at an average rate of one every three months.Afterresidents complained, changes were made to the traffic lights at the intersection. It has now been eight months since the changes were made and there have been no accidents. Were the changes effective or is the 8-month interval without an accident a result of chance?

Probability theory tells us that if the average time between events is $k$ the probability that $X$ , the time between events, is between a and $b$ is given by

P(a ≤ x ≤ b) = ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx where f(x) = {0 if x<0, ke⁻ˣ if x≥0}

Thus, if accidents are occurring at a rate of one every 3 months, then the probability that $X$ , the time between accidents, is between a and $b$ is given by

P(a ≤ x ≤ b) = ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx where f(x) = {0 if x<0, 3e⁻³ˣ if x≥0}

To ansertheguston we mus tompute P(X≥8)=∫₈^∞3e^(-3x)dx and decide theteisiely hat nah could have passed without an accident if there had been no improvement in the traffic situation

## の Solution

We need to calculate the probability as an improper integral

P(X≥8) = ∫₈⁺∞ 3e⁻³ˣ dx = limₜ→⁺∞ ∫₈ᵗ 3e⁻³ˣ dx = limₜ→⁺∞ (-e⁻³ˣ)|₈ᵗ = limₜ→⁺∞ (-e⁻³ᵗ + e⁻²⁴) ≈ 3.8 x 10⁻¹¹

The value 3.8×10⁻¹¹ represents the probability of no accidents in 8 months under the initial conditions.Since this value is very, very small, it is reasonable to conclude the changes were effective.

### Integrating a Discontinuous Integrand

Now let's examine integrals of functions containing an infinite discontinuity in the interval over which the integration occurs. nide an itegra the tor ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx where $f(x)$ i ontinuos over $[a,b)$ and discotuous at $b$ Since the function $f(x)$ is ontiuous over $[a,t]$ for lvalues of satsing $a<t<b$ , the integral ∫ₐᵗf(x)dx isdefine for al such valuesof $l.$ Thus i make ense t consider te va es o ∫ₐᵗf(x)dx as apraches $b$ for $a<1<b$ .Thatis we define ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=lim_(t→b⁻)∫ₐᵗf(x)dx provide thisit eists igure 32 ilusrates ∫ₐᵗf(x)dx as area o regions for values of $t$ approaching $b$

![](./images/f6s4FGVIK1Nau81VbZxItvk46hug1pNUM.png)
Figure 3.21 As tapproaches bfrom the left, the value of the area from ato tapproaches the area from ato b.

We use simlaraprach t defne ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx, Iwhere $f(x)$ i ontinuous ove $(a,b]$ and discontinsu atat $a$ Wenow proceed with a formal definition.

### Definition

1. Let $f(x)$ be continuous over $[a,b)$ . Then,

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=limₜ→b⁻∫ₐᵗf(x)dx

2.Let $f(x)$ be continuous over $(a,b].$ Then,

∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = limₜ→ₐ⁺ ∫ₜᵇ f(x)dx

In each case, if the limit exists, then the improper integral is said to converge. If the limit does not exist, then the improper integral is said to diverge

3.If $f(x)$ is continuous over $[a,b]$ except at a point c in $(a,b)$ ,then
cept at a ponit c in (u,v),cien ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = ∫ₐᶜ f(x)dx + ∫ᶜᵇ f(x)dx,

provided both ∫ₐᶜf(x)dx and ∫_{c}^{b}f(x)dx converge ther o thes integral divergesgthen ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx diverges.

The following examples demonstrate the application of this definition.

### EXAMPLE 3.52

Evaluate the antiderivative.. Evaluate the limit.

### A Comparison Theorem

It is not always easy or even possible to evaluate an improperinteqral directly:however, by comparing it with another carefully chosen integral, it may be possible to determine its convergence or divergence. To see this, consider two continuous functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ satisfying 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ g(x) for x≥a (Figure 3.22). In this case, we may view integrals of these functions over intervals of the form[a,t] as areas, so we have the relationship

0 ≤ ∫ₐᵗ f(x)dx ≤ ∫ₐᵗ g(x)dx for t ≥ a

![](./images/fGVv9VQTED20tZwUM8oty4yprFqkDrf0g.png)

Figure 3.22If 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ g(x) for x≥a ,then for t≥a,∫ₐᵗf(x)dx≤∫ₐᵗg(x)dx

Thus, if

∫ₐ⁺∞ f(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞ ∫ₐᵗ f(x)dx = +∞,

then

∫ₐ⁺∞g(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞∫ₐᵗg(x)dx = +∞ aswell. That is, if the area of the region between the graph of

$x-$ axis over [a,+∞) is infinite,then the area of the region between the graph of $g(x)$ and the x-axis over [a,+∞) is infinite too.

On the otherhand,if

∫_a^∞ g(x)dx = lim_(t→∞) ∫_a^t g(x)dx = L for some real number $L$, then


∫_{a}^∞f(x)dx=lim_{t→∞}∫_{a}^tf(x)dx mst conve t se alues tha or euat $L$ snce ∫ₐᵗf(x) $dx$ increses as Iinceases and ∫(from a to t)f(x)dx≤L for all t≥a

If the areaof theregionbetween the graph of $g(x)$ and the x-axis over [a,+∞) is finite, then the area of the region between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x=$ axis over [a,+∞) is also finite.

These conclusions are summarized in the followinq theorem

### Theorem 3.7

### A Comparison Theorem

Let f(x) and g(x) be continuous over [a,+∞) , Assume that 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ g(x) for x≥a

If ∫ₐ⁺∞f(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞∫ₐᵗf(x)dx = +∞, then ∫ₐ⁺∞g(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞∫ₐᵗg(x)dx = +∞.
1. ∫ₐ⁺∞g(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞∫ₐᵗg(x)dx = L. Wwhere $L$ is rea smbethen

∫ₐ⁺∞ f(x)dx = limₜ→⁺∞ ∫ₐᵗ f(x)dx = Mf

### STUDENT PROJECT

### Laplace Transforms In the last few chapters, we have looked at several ways to use integration for solving real-world problems.For this

next project, we are going to explore a more advanced application of integration: integral transforms. Specifically, we describe the Laplace transform and some of its properties. The Laplace transform is used in engineering and physics to simplify the computationsneeded to solve some problems.It takesfunctions expressed in terms of time and transforms them to functions expressed in terms of frequency.It turns out that, in many cases, the computations needed to solve problems in the frequency domain are much simpler than those required in the time domain.

The Laplace transform is defined in terms of an integral as

L{f(t)}=F(s)=∫₀^∞e⁻ˢᵗf(t)dt

Note that the input to a Laplace transform is a function of time, $f(t)$ , and the output is a function of frequency, $F(s)$ Although many real-world examples require the use of complex numbers (involving the imaginary number i=√-1, in this project we limit ourselves to functions of real numbers.

Let's start with a simple example. Here we calculate the Laplace transform of $f(t)=t.$ We have

L{t}=∫₀^∞ te⁻ˢᵗ dt

This is an improper integral, so we express it in terms of a limit, which gives

L{t}=∫₀^∞te⁻ˢᵗdt=lim₌→∞∫₀ᶻte⁻ˢᵗdt

Now we use integration by parts to evaluate the integral. Note that we are integrating with respect to t, so we treat the variable s as a constant. We have

u=t, dv=e⁻ˢᵗdt; du=dt, v=-(1/s)e⁻ˢᵗ

Then we obtain

lim<sub>z→∞</sub>∫₀<sup>z</sup>te<sup>-st</sup>dt = lim<sub>z→∞</sub>[[(-t/s)e<sup>-st</sup>]₀<sup>z</sup> + (1/s)∫₀<sup>z</sup>e<sup>-st</sup>dt = lim<sub>z→∞</sub>[(-z/s)e<sup>-sz</sup> + 0] - (1/s²)[e<sup>-sz</sup> - 1] = lim<sub>z→∞</sub>[(-z/se<sup>sz</sup>)] - lim<sub>z→∞</sub>[(1/s²e<sup>sz</sup>)] + lim<sub>z→∞</sub>(1/s²) = 0 - 0 + 1/s² = 1/s²

1.Calculate the Laplace transform of $f(t)=1$ 2. Calculate the Laplace transform of $f(t)=e^{-3t}$

3.Calculate the Laplace transform of $f(t)=t^2.$ (Note, you will have to integrate by parts twice.) Laplace transforms are often used to solve differential equations. Differential equations are not covered in detail until laterin thisbook;but,for now,let's lookat the relationship between the Laplace transform of a functior and the Laplace transform of its derivative Let's start with the definition of the Laplace transform. We have

L{f(t)} = ∫₀^∞ e⁻ˢᵗf(t)dt = lim(z→∞)∫₀ᶻ e⁻ˢᵗf(t)dt.

4.Use integration by parts to evaluate lim
lim_(z→∞)∫₀ᶻe⁻ˢᵗf(t)dt. (Let u=f(t) and dv=e⁻ˢᵗdt)

After integrating by parts and evaluating the limit, you should see that
my une minit, you siloulu see ulat L{f(t)}=f(0)/s+1/s[L{f′(t)}].

Then,

L{f'(t)}=sL{f(t)}-f(0)

Thus,differentiation in the time domain simplifies to multiplication by sin the frequency domain The final thing we look at in this project is how the Laplace transforms of $f(t)$ and its antiderivative are related.

Let g(t)=∫₀ᵗf(u)du Then

L{g(t)} = ∫₀^∞e⁻ˢᵗg(t)dt = lim(z→∞)∫₀ᶻe⁻ˢᵗg(t)dt.

5. Us integrtion by artsto evaeatee lim→∞∫₀^z e⁻ˢᵗ g(t) dt (Let) $u=g(t)$ and $dv=e^{-st}dt.$ Note by theway thatwye

have defined g(t) $,du=f(t)dt.$

As you might expect, you should see that

L{g(t)} = (1/s)·L{f(t)}.

Integration in the time domain simplifies to division by $S$ in the frequency domain

### 3.4 Partial Fractions

Partial fraction decomposition is a techniaue used tobreak down arationalfunction into a sum ofsimple rationa

functions that can be integrated using previously learned techniques. When applying partial fraction decomposition, we must make sure that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. If not, we need to perform long division before attempting partial fraction decomposition •The form the decomposition takes depends on the type of factors in the denominator. The types of factors include

nonrepeated linear factors, repeated linear factors, nonrepeated irreducible quadratic factors, and repeated irreducible quadratic factors.

·We can use numerical integration to estimate the values of definite integrals when a closed form of theintegral is difficult to find or when an approximate value only of the definite integral is needed ·The most commonly used techniques for numerical integration are the midpoint rule,trapezoidal rule,and Simpson's rule

·The midpoint rule approximates the definite integral using rectangular regions whereas the trapezoidal rule approximates the definite integral using trapezoidal approximations ·Simpson's rule approximates the definite integral by first approximating the original function using piecewise quadratic functions.

### 3.7 Improper Integrals

Inteqrals of functions overinfinite intervals are defined in terms of limits ·Integrals of functions over an interval for which the function has a discontinuity at an endpoint may be defined ir terms of limits. ·The convergence or divergence of an improper integral may be determined by comparing it with the value of an improper integral for which the convergence or divergence is known.

## Introduction

Many real-world phenomena can be modeled mathematically by using differential equations. Population growth,. radioactive decay, predator-prey models, and spring-mass systems are four examples of such phenomena.In this chapter we study some of these applications.

Suppose we wish to study a population of deer over time and determine the total number of animals in a given area. We can first observe the population over a period of time, estimate the total number of deer, and then use various assumptions to derive a mathematical model for different scenarios.Some factors that are often considered are environmental impact, threshold population values, and predators. In this chapter we see how differential equations can be used to predict populations over time (see Example 4.14)

Another goal of this chapter is to develop solution techniques for different types of differential equations. As the equations become more complicated, the solution techniques also become more complicated, and in fact an entire course could be dedicated to the study of these equations.In this chapter we study several types of differential equations and their corresponding methods of solution

Calculus is the mathematics of change, and rates of change are expressed by derivatives. Thus, one of the most common ways to use calculus is to set up an equation containing an unknown function $y=f(x)$ and its derivative, known as a differential equation. Solving such equations often provides information about how quantities change and frequentl provides insight into how and why the changes occur

Techniques for solving differential equations can take many different forms, including direct solution, use of graphs, or computer calculations. We introduce the main ideas in this chapter and describe them in a little more detail later in the course. In this section we study what differential equations are, how to verify their solutions, some methods that are used for solving them, and some examples of common and useful equations.

# General Differential Equations.

Consider the equation y'=3x² , which is an example of a differential equation because it includes a derivative. There is a relationship between the variables X and y: y is an unknown function of $x$ .Furthermore, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of y. Therefore we can interpret this equation as follows: Start with some function $y=f(x)$ and take its derivative. The answer must be equal to $3x^2$ .What function has a derivative that is equal to $3x^2$ ?One such function is $y=x^{3}$ so thisfunction is considered a solution toa differential equation

### Definition

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function $y=f(x)$ and one or more of its derivatives.A solution to a differential equation is a function $y=f(x)$ that satisfies the differential equation when $f$ and its derivatives are substituted into the equation.

Some examples of differential equations and their solutions appear in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1 Examples of Differential Equations and Their Solutions

Note that a solution to a differential equation is not necessarily unique, primarily because the derivative of a constant is zero. For example, $y=x^{2}+4$ is also a solution to the first differential equation in Table 4.1. We will return to this idea a little bit later in this section.For now, let's focus on what it means for a function to be a solution to a differential equation.

# EXAMPLE 4.1

### Verifying Solutions of Differential Equations Verify that the function $y=e^{-3x}+2x+3$ is a solution to the differential equation y' + 3y = 6x + 11

![](./images/foG6k39g2hqvoDLER15hwRQRqrVAl9HLT.png)

### Solutior

To verify the solution, we first calculate y' using the chain rule for derivatives. This gives y'=-3e⁻³ˣ+2 Next we substitute $y$ and y' into the left-hand side of the differential equation:

$$(-3e^{-3x}+2)+3(e^{-3x}+2x+3).$$

The resulting expression can be simplified by first distributing to eliminate the parentheses, giving

$$-3e^{-3x}+2+3e^{-3x}+6x+9.$$

Combining like terms leads to the expression $6x+11$ , which is equal to the right-hand side of the differential equation This result verifies that $y=e^{-3x}+2x+3$ is a solution of the differential equation

![](./images/fxgA4PGi5MSE2Mp60ONyySzQB3fUUPWWZ.png)

4.1 Verify that $y=2e^{3x}-2x-2$ is a solution to the differential equation y' - 3y = 6x + 4.

It is convenient to define characteristics of differential equations that make it easier to talk about them and categorize them.The most basiccharacteristic of a differential equation is its order

## Definition

The order of a differential equation is thehighest order of any derivative of theunknown function that appears in the equation.

# EXAMPLE 4.2

### Identifying the Order of a Differential Equation

What is the order of each of the following differential equations?

a. y'-4y=x²-3x+4 b. 
x²y'' - 3xy' + xy' - 3y = sin x C. 4/xy⁽⁴⁾-6/x²y′+12/x⁴y=x³-3x²+4x-12

## $②$ Solution

a.The highest derivative in the equation is y' , so the order is 1. b.The highest derivative in the equation is y⁰v , so the order is 3. C.The highest derivative in the equation is $y^{(4)}$ , so the order is 4.

4.2 What is the order of the following differential equation?

(x⁴ - 3x)y⁽⁵⁾ - (3x² + 1)y' + 3y = sin x cos x

## General and Particular Solutions

We already noted that the differential equation 
y' = 2x has at least two solutions: $y=x^{2}$ and $y=x^{2}+4$ The only difference between these two solutions is the last term, which is a constant.What if the last term is a different constant? Will this expression still be a solution to the differential equation? In fact, any function of the form $y=x^{2}+C$ ,where $C$ represents any constant, is a solution as well. The reason is that the derivative of $x^{2}+C$ is $2x$ ,regardless of the value of C.It can be shown that any solution of this differential equationmust be of the form $y=x^{2}+C$ . This is an example of a general solution to a differential equation. A graph of some of these solutions is given in Eigure 4.2. (Note: in this graph we used even integer values for $C$ ranging between -4 and 4. In fact, there is no restriction on the value of C ;it can be an integer or not.)

Figure 4.2Family of solutions to the differential equation 
y' = 2x

In this example, we are free to choose any solution we wish; for example, $y=x^{2}-3$ is a member of the family of solutions to this differential equation.This is called a particular solution to the differential equation.A particular solution can often be uniquely identified if we are given additional information about the problem.

## EXAMPLE 4.3

### Finding a Particular Solution

Find the particular solution to the differential equation 
y' = 2x passing through the point (2,7)

![](./images/fNKqBCSpPdAGKxEvxTKsClV3DOCgFFdBk.png)

### Solution

Any function of the form $y=x^{2}+C$ is a solution to this differential equation.To determine the value of $C$ we substitute the values $x=2$ and $y=7$ into this equation and solve for $C$


y = x²+C; 7 = 2²+C = 4+C; C=3

Therefore the particular solution passing through the point (2,7) is $y=x^{2}+3$

![](./images/fagcgmOsgm3c5PZsLXX2D3WIBNaUoEb87.png)

4.3 Find the particular solution to the differential equation

$$y'=4x+3$$

passing through the point (1, 7), given that $y=2x^{2}+3x+C$ is a general solution to the differentia equation.

## Initial-Value Problems

Usually a given differential equation has an infinite number of solutions, so it is natural to ask which one we want to use. To choose one solution,more information is needed.Some specific information that can be useful is an initial value which is an ordered pair that is used to find a particular solution

A differential equation together with one or more initial values is called an initial-value problem. The general rule is that the number of initial values needed for an initial-value problem is equal to the order of the differential equation. For example, if we have the differential equation 
y' = 2x ,then $y(3)=7$ is an initial value, and when taken together, these equations form an initial-value problem. The differential equation y''-3y'+2y=4eˣ is second order, so we need two initial values. With initial-value problems of order greater than one, the same value should be used for the independent variable. An example of initial values for this second-order equation would be $y(0)=2$ and y'(0) = -1  . These two initial values together with the differential equation form an initial-value problem. These problems are so named because often the independent variable in the unknown function is t, which represents time. Thus, a value of $t=0$ represents the beginning of the problem.

# EXAMPLE 4.4

## Verifying a Solution to an Initial-Value Problem Verify that thefunction $y=2e^{-2t}+e^{t}$ is a solution to the initial-value problem

y' + 2y = 3eᵗ, y(0) = 3

### Solution

For a function to satisfy an initial-value problem, it must satisfy both the differential equation and the initial condition. To show that $y$ satisfies the differential equation, we start by calculating y' . This gives y'=-4e⁻²ᵗ+eᵗ Next we substitute both $y$ and y' into the left-hand side of the differential equation and simplify

y' + 2y = (-4e<sup>-2t</sup> + e<sup>t</sup>) + 2(2e<sup>-2t</sup> + e<sup>t</sup>) = -4e<sup>-2t</sup> + e<sup>t</sup> + 4e<sup>-2t</sup> + 2e<sup>t</sup> = 3e<sup>t</sup>.

This is equal to the right-hand side of the differential equation, o $y=2e^{-2t}+e^{I}$ solves the differential equation. Next we calculate $y(0)$

y(0)=3

This result yerifies the initial yalue.Therefore the given function satisfies the initial-value problem

![](./images/fC5S8NMyPSn50fSbq4tbp0lG0ZVnDMUyc.png)

4.4 Verify that y=3e<sup>2t</sup>+4sin t is a solution to the initial-value problem
y'-2y=4cost-8sint, y(0)=3

In Example 4.4, the initial-value problem consisted of two parts. The first part was the differential equation

y'+2y=3e^I ,and thesecondpart was the initial value $y(0)=3$ These two equations together formed the initial-value problem.

The same is true in general. An initial-value problem consists of two parts: the differential equation and the initial condition. The differential equation has a family of solutions, and the initial condition determines the value of $C$ The family of solutions to the differential equation inExample 4.4isgiven by $y=2e^{-2t}+Ce^{t}$ This family of solutions is shown inEigure 4.3,with the particular solution $y=2e^{-2t}+e^{t}$ labeled

![](./images/fIiTSttBYKbTgY2ZBVy24iq8u73myHwUQ.png)

Figure 4.3A family of solutions to the differential equation y'+2y=3eᵗ The particular solution $y=2e^{-2t}+e^{t}$ is labeled.

# EXAMPLE 4.5

Solving an Initial-value Problem

Solve the following initial-value problem

y' = 3eˣ + x² - 4, y(0) = 5

## $②$ Solution

The first step in solving this initial-value problem is to find a general family of solutions. To do this, we find an antiderivative of both sides of the differential equatior

∫y'dx=∫(3eˣ+x²-4)dx,

namely,

y+C₁=3eˣ+⅓x³-4x+C₂

We are able to integrate both sides because the y term appears by itself. Notice that there are two integration constants: $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ . Solving Equation 4.1 for $y$ gives

y = 3eˣ + ⅓x³ - 4x + C₂ - C₁.

Because $C_1$ and $C_{2}$ are both constants, $C_{2}-C_{1}$ is also a constant.We can therefore define C = C₂ - Cₗ ,which leads to the equation

y=3e^x+1/3x³-4x+C

Next we determine the value of $C.$ To do this, we substitute $x=0$ and $y=5$ into Eauation 4.1and solve for $C$

5=3e⁰+1/3(0)³-4(0)+C; 5=3+C; C=2.

Now we substitute the value $C=2$ into Equation 4.1. The solution to the initial-value problem is y=3e<sup>x</sup>+(1/3)x³-4x+2

## ® Analysis

The differencebetween a qeneral solution and a particularsolution is that a general solutioninvolvesafamily of functions, either explicitly or implicitly defined, of the independent variable. The initial value or values determine which particularsolution in the family of solutions satisfies the desired conditions.

4.5 Solve the initial-value problem
y' = x² - 4x + 3 - 6eˣ, y(0) = 8

In physics and enqineering applications, we often consider the forces acting upon an object, and use this information to understand the resulting motion that may occur. For example, if we start with an object at Earth's surface, the primary force acting upon that object is gravity. Physicists and engineers can use this information, along with Newton's second law of motion (in equation form $F=ma$ ,where $F$ represents force, m represents mass, and a represents acceleration) toderive an equation that can be solved

![](./images/fRK4LbFbvr46U8sWz0U6rigyEUV2lS5Hq.png)

Figure 4.4 For a baseball falling in air, the only force acting on it is gravity (neglecting air resistance)

In Figure 4.4 we assume that the only force acting on a baseball is the force of gravity. This assumption ignores air resistance.(The force due to air resistance is considered in a later discussion.) The acceleration due to qravity at Earth' surface, g, is approximately $9.8m/s^2$ We introduce a frame of reference, where Earth's surface is at a height of O meters. Let v(t) represent the velocity of the object in meters per second. If v(t)>0 , the ball is rising, and if υ(t)<0 , the ball is falling (Fiqure 4.5)

![](./images/f2zy07U4bI3nTG5EqUAC5ii3dgFMwWmLA.png)

Figure 4.5 Possible velocities for the rising/falling baseball

Our goal is to solve for the velocity υ(t) at any time t.To do this, we set up an initial-value problem.Suppose the mass of the ball is $m$ where $m$ is measured in kilograms.We use Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration $F=ma$ ).Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so a(t) = v'(t) Therefore the force acting on the baseball is given by $F= m$ v'(t) . However, this force must be equal to the force of gravity acting on the object, which (again using Newton's second law) is given by F꜀=-mg , since this force acts in a downward direction. Therefore we obtain the equation F=F₉ ,which becomes m v'(t) = -mg .Dividing both sides of the equation by $m$ gives the equation

$$v'(t)=-g.$$

Notice that this differential equation remains the same regardless of the mass of the object

We now need an initial value.Because we are solving forvelocity,it makes sense in the context of the problem to assume that we know the initial velocity, or the velocity at time $t=0$ .This is denoted by $v(0)=v_{0}$

## EXAMPLE 4.6

## Velocity of a Moving Baseball

A baseball is thrown upward from a height of 3 meters above Earth's surface with an initial velocity of $10m/s$ ,and the only force acting on it is gravity. The ball has a mass of $0.15kg$

a.Find the velocity v(t) of the baseball at time f. b.What is its velocity after 2 seconds?

![](./images/fi08N5cl30Enl0G9pABaoRwGilwu2r4fh.png)

### Solution

a.From the preceding discussion, the differential equation that applies in this situation is

where $g= 9. 8$ m/s² .The initial condition is $v(0)=v_{0}$ ,where $v_{0}=10$m/s Therefore the initial-value problem is v'(t)=-9.8m/s$^2,v(0)=10$m/s υ(0) = 10m/s υ(0) = 10m/s

The first step in solving this initial-value problem is to take the antiderivative of both sides of the differentia equation. This gives
∫v'(t)dt=∫-9.8dt; v(t)=-9.8t+C.

The next step is to solve for $C.$ To do this, substitute $l=0$ and $v(0)=10$
Substitute t = 0 and v(0) = 10. v(t) = -9.8t + C, v(0) = -9.8(0) + C, 10 = C.

Therefore $C=10$ and the velocity function is given by $v(t)=-9.8t+10$ b.To find the velocity after 2 seconds, substitute $l=2$ into v(t)
eı = 2 mito v(ı); v(t) = -9.8t + 10; v(2) = -9.8(2) + 10; v(2) = -9.6

The units of velocity are meters per second. Since the answer is negative, the object is falling at a speed of $9.6m/s$

![](./images/feH7DRskCyWepgTsTGdVZTQH6ggPMie5r.png)

4.6 Suppose a rock falls from rest from a height of 100 meters and the only force acting on it is gravity. Find an equation for the velocity U(t) as a function of time, measured in meters per second

A natural question to ask after solving this type of problem is how high the object will be above Earth's surface at a given point in time. Let s (t) denote the height above Earth's surface of the object, measured in meters. Because velocity is the derivative of position (in this case height), this assumption gives the equation s' s s'(t) = v(t) . An initial value is necessary; in this case the initial height of the object works well. Let the initial height be given by the equation s(0) = s₀ . Together these assumptions give the initial-value problem

s'(t)=v(t), s(0)=s₀

If the velocity function is known, then it is possible to solve for the position function as well.

# EXAMPLE 4.7

## Height of a Moving Baseball

A baseball is thrown upward from a height of 3 meters above Earth's surface with an initial velocity of $10m/s$ ,and the only force acting on it is gravity. The ball has a mass of 0.15 kilogram.

a.Find the position s(t) of the baseball at time $t$ b.What is its height after 2 seconds?

## $②$ Solution

a.We already know the velocity function for this problem is $v(t)=-9.8t+10.$ The initial height of the baseball is 3 meters, so $s_0=3$ .Therefore the initial-value problem for this example is To solve the initial-value problem, we first find the antiderivatives
∫s'(t)dt=∫-9.8t+10dt, s(t)=-4.9t²+10t+C

Next we substitute $t=0$ and solve for $C$

s(t) = -4.9t² + 10t + C, s(0) = -4.9(0)² + 10(0) + C, 3 = C.

Therefore the position function is s(t) = -4.9t² + 10t + 3 b.The height of the baseball after 2 s is given by s(2)

TIUYSL s(2) = -4.9(2)²+10(2)+3 = -4.9(4)+23 = 3.4

Therefore the baseball is 3.4 meters above Earth's surface after 2 seconds. It is worth noting that the mass of the ball cancelled out completely in the process of solving the problem

# 4.2 Direction Fields and Numerical Methods.

## Learning Objectives

4.2.1 Draw the direction field for a given first-order differential equation 4.2.2 Use a direction field to draw a solution curve of a first-order differential equation 4.2.3 Use Eulers Method to approximate the solution to a first-order differential equation

For the rest of this chapter we will focus on various methods for solving differential equations and analyzing the behavior of the solutions. In some cases it is possible to predict properties of a solution to a differential equation without knowing the actual solution. We will also study numerical methods for solving differential equations, which can be programmed by using various computer languages or even by using a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.

## Creating Direction Fields

Direction fields (also called slope fields) are useful for investigating first-order differential equations. In particular, we consider a first-order differential equation of the form

y' = f(x,y)

An applied example of this type of differential equation appears in Newton's law of cooling, which we will solve explicitly later in this chapter. First, though, let us create a direction field for the differential equation

T'(t) = -0.4(T-72)

Here $T(t)$ represents the temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) of an object at time t, and the ambient temperature i 72°F. Eiqure 4.6 shows the direction field for this equation

Figure 4.6Direction field for the differential equation T′(t)=-0.4(T-72) Two solutions are plotted: one with initial temperature less than 72°F and the other with initial temperature greater than 72°F

The idea behind a direction field is the fact that the derivative of a function evaluated at a given point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of that function at the same point. Other examples of differential equations for which we car create a direction field include

y'=3x+2y-4; y'=x²-y²; y'=(2x+4)/(y-2)

To create a direction field, we start with the first equation: y'=3x+2y-4 . We let $(x_0,y_0)$ be any ordered pair, and we substitute these numbers into the right-hand side of the differential equation. For example, if we choose $x=1$ and $y=2$ , substituting into the right-hand side of the differential equation yields

y' = 3x+2y-4 = 3(1)+2(2)-4=3

This tells us that if a solution to the differential equation y'=3x+2y-4 passes through the point (1,2),then the slope of the solution at that point must equal 3.To start creating the direction field,we put a short line segment at the point (1,2) having slope 3. We can do this for any point in the domain of the function $f(x,y)=3x+2y-4$ ,which consists of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ inR2.Therefore any point in the Cartesian plane has a slope associated with it,assuming that a solution to the differential equation passes through that point. The direction field for the differential equation y'=3x+2y-4 is shown in Eigure 4.7

Figure 4.7 Direction field for the differential equation y′=3x+2y-4

We can generate a direction field of this type for any differential equation of the form y' = f(x,y)

## Definition

A direction field (slope field) is a mathematical object used to graphically represent solutions to a first-order differential equation. At each point in a direction field, a line segment appears whose slope is equal to the slope of a solution to the differential equation passing through that point.

# Using Direction Fields

Wecan use a direction field to predict thebehavior of solutions to a differentialequation without knowinq the actual solution.For example, the direction field in Eiqure 4.7 serves as a guide to the behavior of solutions to the differential equation y'=3x+2y-4

To use a direction field, we start by choosing any point in the field. The line segment at that point serves as a signpost telling us what direction to go from there.For example,if a solution to the differential equation passes through the point (0,1) , then the slope of the solution passing through that point is given by y'=3(0)+2(1)-4=-2 .Now let x increase slightly, say to $x=0.1$ . Using the method of linear approximations gives a formula for the approximate value of $y$ for $x=0.1$ . In particular,

L(x) = y₀ + f'(x₀)(x - x₀) = 1 - 2(x - 0) = 1 - 2x

Substituting $x=0.1$ into $L(x)$ gives an approximate $y$ value of 0.8.

At this point the slope of the solution changes (again according to the differential equation). We can keep progressing recalculating the slope of the solution as we take small steps to the right, and watching the behavior of the solution. Figure 4.8 shows a graph of the solution passing through the point (0,1)

![](./images/fgHu37vwF8hHA1YzF3SmnpXGLu6EFAgug.png)
Figure 4.8 Direction field for the differential equation y'=3x+2y-4 with the solution passing through the point

(0,1)

The curve is the graph of the solution to the initial-value problem

y' = 3x + 2y - 4, y(0) = 1

This curve is called a solution curve passing through the point (0,1). The exact solution to this initial-value problem is

y=-(3/2)x+(5/4)-(1/4)e^(2x)

and the graph of this solution is identical to the curve in Figure 4.8.

4.7 Create a direction field for the differential equation y' = x² - y² and sketch a solution curve passing through the point (-1,2)

Now consider the direction field for the diferential equation y'=(x-3)(y²-4) , shown in Figure 4.9. This direction field has several interesting properties. First of all, at $y=-2$ and $y=2$ , horizontal dashes appear all the way across the graph. This means that if $y=-2$ ,then y'=0 .Substituting this expression into the right-hand side of the differential equation gives

(x-3)(y²-4) (x-3)((-2)²-4) =(x-3)(0) =0 =y'

Therefore $y=-2$ is a solution to the differential equation.Similarly, $y=2$ is a solution to the differential equation.These are the only constant-valued solutions to the differential equation,as we can see from the following arqument.Suppose $y=k$ is a constant solution to the differential equation. Then y'=0 . Substituting this expression into the differential equation yields 0 = (x - 3)(k² - 4) This equation must be true for al values of $X$ so the second factormust equal zero. This result yields the equation $k^{2}-4=0$ .The solutions to this equation are $k=-2$ and $k=2$ ,which are the constant solutions already mentioned. These are called the equilibrium solutions to the differential equation

Figure 4.9 Direction field for the differential equation y'=(x-3)(y²-4) showing two solutions. These solutions are very close together, but one is barely above the equilibrium solution $x=-2$ and the other is barely below the same equilibrium solution.

### Definition

Consider the differential equation y'=f(x,y) An equilibrium solution is any solution to the differential equation of the form $y=c$, where $c$ is a constant

To determine the equilibrium solutions to the differential equation y' = f(x,y) , set the right-hand side equal to zero. An equilibrium solution of the differential equation is any function of the form $y=k$ such that $f(x,k)=0$ for all values of $x$ in the domain of $f$

An important characteristic of equilibrium solutions concerns whether or not they approach the line $y=k$ as ar asymptote for large values of $X$

### Definition

Consider the differential equation y′=f(x,y) , and assume that all solutions to this differential equation are definec for x≥x₀ Let $y=k$ be an equilibrium solution to the differential equation.

1. $y=k$ is an asymptotically stable solution to the differential equation if there exists 
ε>0 such that for any value c ∈ (k - ε, k + ε) the solution to the initial-value problem
y' = f(x,y), y(x₀) = c

approaches $k$ as x approaches infinity

2. $y=k$ is an asymptotically unstable solution to the differentialequation if there exists 
ε>0 such that for any value c ∈ (k - ε, k + ε) the solution to the initial-value problem
y' = f(x,y), y(x₀) = c

never approaches $k$ asx approaches infinity

3. $y=k$ is an asymptotically semi-stable solution to the differential equation if it is neither asymptotically stabl nor asymptotically unstable

Now we return to the differential equation y'=(x-3)(y²-4) ,with the initial condition $y(0)=0.5$ .The direction fielc for this initial-value problem, along with the corresponding solution, is shown in Figure 4.10

![](./images/fM5qHGViBYtUWzOCUTa2MXs9cmfkL7EiC.png)
Figure 4.10 Direction field for the initial-value problem y'=(x-3)(y²-4), y(0)=0.5

The values of the solution to this initial-value problem stay between $y=-2$ and $y=2$ , which are the equilibrium solutions to the differential equation. However, an initial-value problem starting with $-2<y<2$ can never cross the equilibrium solutions $y=2$ and $y=-2$ . Therefore, since $y^{2}-4<0$ and for x>3, y'=(x-3)(y²-4)<0 yis decreasing and therefore approaches $y=-2$ . Therefore, $y=-2$ is an asymptotically stable solution to the differential equation.

What happens when the initial value is below $y=-2?$ This scenario is illustrated in Figure 4.11, with the initial value $y(0)=-3$

![](./images/fBexo36EHK5Y5G4OrnFmZmxbMXOAsM78N.png)
Figure 4.11 Direction field for the initial-value problem 
y' = (x-3)(y²-4), $y( 0) = - 3.$

We can see that for initial values $y<-2$ for x > 3, y'(x -3)(y² -4) > 0 and $y$ is increasing and therefore approaches $y=-2$ This reaffirms that $y=-2$ is an asymptotically stable solution to the differential equation.

### EXAMPLE 4.8

## Stability of an Equilibrium Solution Create a direction field for the differential equation y' = (y-3)²(y²+y-2) and identify any equilibrium solutions.

Classify each of the equilibrium solutions as stable, unstable, or semi-stable

### Solution

The direction field is shown in Eiqure 4.12

![](./images/f60IN6ozZpxy8Yq7PKpg9PK4LX3pO18US.png)
Figure 4.12 Direction field for the differential equation y' = (y-3)²(y²+y-2)

The equilibrium solutions are $y=-2,y=1$ , and $y=3.$ To classify each of the solutions, look at an arrow directly above or below each of these values. For example, at $y=-2$ the arrows directly below this solution point up, and the arrows directly above the solution point down.Therefore all initial conditions close to $y=-2$ approach $y=-2$ ,and the solution is stable.For the solution $y=1$ , allinitial conditions above and below $y=1$ are repelled (pushed away) from $y=1$ ,So this solution is unstable. The solution $y=3$ is semi-stable, because for initial conditions slightly greater than 3, the solution approaches infinity, and for initial conditions slightly less than 3, the solution approaches $y=3$

![](./images/fGuh62II62EIU9G4fqiONtGxVvGkvg4oP.png)

### Analysis It is possible to find the equilibrium solutions to the differential equation by seting the right-hand side equal to zero and

solving for y. This approach gives the same equilibrium solutions as those we saw in the direction field

4.8 Create a direction field for the diferential equation y' = (x+5)(y+2)(y²-4y+4) and identify any equilibrium solutions. Classify each of the equilibrium solutions as stable, unstable, or semi-stable.

# Euler's Method

Consider the initial-value problem

y' = 2x - 3, y(0) = 3

Integrating both sides of the differential equation gives $y=x^{2}-3x+C$ and solving for $C$ yields the particular solution $y=x^{2}-3x+3$ The solution for this initial-value problem appears as the parabola in Figure 4.13

![](./images/fM8eX0HQ1CADFKzxBmzU96ciaEb55ovmG.png)
Figure 4.13 Euler's Method for the initial-value problem y'=2x-3, $y( 0) = 3.$

The red graph consists of line segments that approximate the solution to the initial-value problem. The graph starts at the same initial value of (0,3) . Then the slope of the solution at any point is determined by the right-hand side of the differential equation, and the lenqth of the line seqment is determined by increasinq the $x$ value by 0.5each time (the step size). This approach is the basis of Euler's Method.

Before we state Euler's Method as a theorem,let's consider another initial-value problem

y' = x² - y², y(-1) = 2

The idea behind direction fields can also be applied to this problem to study the behavior of its solution. For example, at the point (-1,2) , the slope of the solution is given by y' = (-1)² - 2² = -3 ,so the slope of the tangent line to the solution at that point is also equal to -3 . Now we define $x_{0}=-1$ and $y_{0}=2$ . Since the slope of the solution at this point is equal to -3 ,we can use the method of linear approximation to approximate $y$ near (-1,2)

L(x)=y₀+f′(x₀)(x-x₀)

Here $x_{0}=-1,y_{0}=2$ and f′(x₀)=-3, so the linear approximation becomes

L(x) = 2-3(x-(-1)) = 2-3x-3 = -3x-1

Now we choose a step size. The step size is a small value, typically 0.1 or less, that serves as an increment for $x$ it is represented by the variable $h$ . In our example, let $h=0.1$ . Incrementing $x_0$ by $h$ gives our next $x$ value

$$x_{1}=x_{0}+h=-1+0.1=-0.9.$$

We can substitute $x_{1}=-0.9$ into the linear approximation to calculate $y_1$

y₁ = L(x₁) = -3(-0.9) - 1 = 1.7

Therefore the approximate $y$ value for the solution when $x=-0.9$ is $y=1.7.$ We can then repeat the process, using $x_{1}=-0.9$ and $y_{1}=1.7$ to calculate $x_2$ and $y_{2}$ . The new slope is given by 
y'=(-0.9)²-(1.7)²=-2.08 First $x_{2}=x_{1}+h=-0.9+0.1=-0.8$ Using linear approximation gives

11, L(x) = y₁ + f'(x₁)(x - x₁) = 1.7 - 2.08(x - (-0.9)) = 1.7 - 2.08x - 1.872 = -2.08x - 0.172

Finally, we substitute $x_{2}=-0.8$ into the linear approximation to calculate $y_{2}$


y₂=L(x₂)=-2.08x₂-0.172=-2.08(-0.8)-0.172=1.492

Therefore the approximate value of the solution to the differential equation is $y=1.492$ when $x=-0.8$

What we have just shown is the idea behind Euler's Method. Repeating these steps gives a list of values for the solution. These values are shown in Table 4.2, rounded off to four decimal places

Table 4.2 Using Euler's Method to Approximate Solutions to a Differential Equation

### Theorem 4.1

### Euler's Method

Consider the initial-value problem

y'=f(x,y), y(x₀)=y₀.

To approximate a solution to this problem using Euler'smethod,define

xₙ = x₀ + nh; yₙ = yₙ₋₁ + hf(xₙ₋₁, yₙ₋₁)

Here $h>0$ represents the step size and $n$ is an integer, starting with 1. The number of steps taken is counted by the variable n.

Typically $h$ is a small value, say 0.1 or 0.05. The smaller the value of $h$ , the more calculations are needed. The higher the value of $h$ , the fewer calculations are needed. However, the tradeoffresults in a lower degree of accuracy for larger step size, as illustrated in Figure 4.14

# 4.3 Separable Equations

# Learning Objectives

4.3.1 Use separation of variables to solve a differential equation. 4.3.2 Solve applications using separation of variables.

We now examine a solution technique for finding exact solutions to a class of differential equations known as separable differential equations. These equations are common in a wide variety of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and engineering.We illustrate a few applications at the end of the section.

## Separation of Variables

We start with a definition and some examples

### Definition

A separable differential equation is any equation that can be written in the form

y'=f(x)g(y)

The term‘separable'refers to the fact that the riqht-hand side of the equation can be separated into a function of $x$ times a function of $y$ . Examples of separable differential equations include

y=(x²-4)(3y+2), y=6x²+4x, y=secy+tany, y=xy+3x-2y-6

The second equation is separable with f(x)=6x²+4x and $g(y)=1$ ,the third equation is separable with f(x)=1 and g(y) = sec y + tan y ,and the right-hand side of the fourth equation can be factored as $(x-2)(y+3)$ , so it is separable as well.The third equation isalso called an autonomous differential equationbecause theriqht-hand side of the equation is a function of $y$ alone. If a differential equation is separable, then it is possible to solve the equation using the method of separation of variables

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Separation of Variables

1.Check for any values of y that make $g(y)=0$ . These correspond to constant solutions.. 2. Rewrite thedifferenia equationin the form dy/g(y)=f(x)dx 3. Inteqrate both sides of the equation 4.Solve the resulting equation for $y$ if possible 5.If an initial condition exists,substitute the appropriate values for $x$ and yinto theequation andsolvefor the constant.

Note that Step 4. states Solve the resulting equation for $y$ if possible." It is not always possible to obtain y as an explicit function of $x.$ Quite often we have to be satisfied with finding $y$ as an implicit function of $x$

## EXAMPLE 4.10

### Using Separation of Variables

Find a general solution to the differential equation y'=(x²-4)(3y+2) using the method of separation of variables.

## $②$ Solution

1.In this example, $f(x)=x^{2}-4$ and g(y) = 3y + 2 . Setting $g(y)=0$ gives y=-2/3 as a constant solution 2.Rewrite the differential equation in the form
dy/(3y+2)=(x²-4)dx

3.Integrate both sides of the equation:

∫dy/(3y+2) = ∫(x² - 4)dx

Let $u=3y+2$ Then du =3dx,so the equation become
(1/3)∫(1/u) du = (1/3)x³ - 4x + C; (1/3)ln|u| = (1/3)x³ - 4x + C; (1/3)ln|3y+2| = (1/3)x³ - 4x + C

4.To solve this equation for $y$ ,first multiply both sides of the equation by 3.
ln|3y+2| = x³ - 12x + 3C

Now we use some logic in dealing with the constant $C$ .Since $C$ represents an arbitrary constant, $3C$ also represents an arbitrary constant. If we call the second arbitrary constant Cₗ , the equation becomes
ln|3y+2|=x³-12x+C₁.

Now exponentiate both sides of the equation (i.e., make each side of the equation the exponent for the base e)
III.e., IIIake eaCII sIUE UI UIE; e^(ln|3y+2|) = e^(x³-12x+C₁); |3y+2| = e^(C₁)e^(x³-12x)

Again define a new constant C₂=e^c1 (note that $C_{2}>0)$ |3y + 2| = C2ex3-12x

This corresponds to two separate equations: $3y+2=C_{2}e^{x^{3}-12x}$ and $3y+ 2= - C_{2}e^{x^{3}- 12x}$ . The slutio t ithe equatin can be wrte inthe formn y=(-2±C₂eˣ³⁻¹²ˣ)/3

Since $C_{2}>0$ , it does not matter whether we use plus or minus, so the constant can actually have either sign Furthermore, the subscript on the constant $C$ is entirely arbitrary,and can be dropped.Therefore the solution car be written as
y=(-2+Ceˣ³⁻¹²ˣ)/3

5.No initial condition is imposed, so we are finished

4.10 Use the method of separation of variables to find a qeneral solution to the differential equation y' = 2xy + 3y - 4x - 6.

## EXAMPLE 4.11

### Solving an Initial-Value Problem

Using the method of separation of variables, solve the initial-value problem

y' = (2x + 3)(y² - 4), y(0) = -1

## $②$ Solution

Follow the five-step method of separation of variables.

1.In this example, $f(x)=2x+3$ and $g(y)=y^{2}-4$ Setting $g(y)=0$ gives y=±2 as constant solutions 2.Divide both sides of the equation by $y^{2}-4$ and multiply by $dx$ .This gives the equation
dy/(y²-4)=(2x+3)dx

3.Next inteqrate both sides

∫1/(y²-4)dy=∫(2x+3)dx

To evaluate the left-hand side, use the method of partial fraction decomposition. This leads to the identity
1/(y²-4)=1/4(1/(y-2)-1/(y+2))

ThenEquation 4.4 becomes

(1/4)∫((1/(y-2)) - (1/(y+2)))dy = ∫(2x+3)dx; (1/4)(ln|y-2| - ln|y+2|) = x² + 3x + C.

 Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4 and replacing $4C$ with $C_{1}$ gives
ln|y-2|-ln|y+2|=4x²+12x+C₁; ln|(y-2)/(y+2)|=4x²+12x+C₁

4.It is possible to solve this equation for y. First exponentiate both sides of the equation and define $C_{2}=e^{C_{1}}$
|(y-2)/(y+2)| = C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ

Next we can remove the absolute value and let $C_{2}$ be either positive or negative. Then multiply both sides by $y+2$

y - 2 = C₂(y + 2)e^(4x² + 12x); y - 2 = C₂ye^(4x² + 12x) + 2C₂e^(4x² + 12x)

Now collect all terms involving y on one side of the equation, and solve for y:
onle sioe ol the equation, and solve lor y. y - C₂ye⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ = 2 + 2C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ y(1 - C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ) = 2 + 2C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ y = (2 + 2C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ)/(1 - C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹²ˣ)

5.To determine the value of $C_2$ , substitute $x=0$ and $y=-1$ into the general solution.Alternatively,we can put the same values into an earlier equation,namely the equation (y - 2)/(y + 2) = C₂e⁴ˣ⁺¹² . This is much easier to solve for $C_{2}$

(y-2)/(y+2) = C₂e⁴ˣ²+¹²ˣ, (-1-2)/(-1+2) = C₂e⁰, C₂=-3

Therefore the solution to the initial-value problem is

y=(2-6e⁴ˣ²+¹²ˣ)/(1+3e⁴ˣ²+¹²ˣ)

A graph of this solution appears in Eigure 4.15

# Applications of Separation of Variables

Many interesting problems can be described by separable equations. We illustrate two types of problems: solution concentrations and Newton's law of cooling

### Solution concentrations

Consider a tank being filled with a salt solution. We would like to determine the amount of salt present in the tank as a function of time. We can apply the process of separation of variables to solve this problem and similar problems involving solution concentrations.

## EXAMPLE 4.12

### Determining Salt Concentration over Time

A tank containing $100L$ of a brine solution initially has $4kg$ of salt dissolved in the solution.At time $t=0$ , another brine solution flows into the tank at a rate of $2L/$min This brine solution contains a concentration of 0.5 kg/L of salt. At the same time, a stopcock is opened at the bottom of the tank, allowing the combined solution to flow out at a rate of $2L/min$ , so that the level of liquid in the tank remains constant (Eigure 4.16). Find the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time (measured in minutes), and find the limiting amount of salt in the tank, assuming that the solution in the tank is well mixed at all times.

![](./images/fquRp4cWdupE10aGpVPn6mNwa1yoXXuvV.png)

Figure 4.16 A brine tank with an initial amount of salt solution accepts an input flow and delivers an output flow.How does the amount of salt change with time?

## $②$ Solution

First we define a function $u(t)$ that represents the amount of salt in kilograms in the tank as a function of time. Then du/dt represents the rate at which the amount of salt in the tank changes as a function of time. Also, u(0) represents the amount of salt in the tank at time $t=0$ ,which is 4 kilograms

The general setup for the differential equation we will solve is of the form

du/dt = INFLOW RATE - OUTFLOW RATE.

INFLOw RATE represents the rate at which salt enters the tank, and OUTFLOw RATE represents the rate at which salt leaves the tank.Because solution enters the tank at a rate of 2L/min,and eachliter of solution contains 0.5kiloqram of salt, every minute 2(0.5)=1 kilogram of salt enters the tank. Therefore INFLOw RATE =1

To calculate the rate at which salt leaves the tank, we need the concentration of salt in the tank at any point in time Since the actualamount of salt yaries over time.so does the concentration of salt. However the yolume of the solutior remains fixed at 10o liters. The number of kilograms of salt in the tank at time t is equal to u(t). Thus, the concentratior of salt is u(t)/100 kg/L , and the solution leaves the tank at a rate of 2 L/min. Therefore salt leaves the tank at a rate off u(t)/100 * 2 = u(t)/50 kg/min and OUTFLOW RATE is equal to u(t)/50 . Therefore the differential equation becomes du/dt=1-u/50 and the initial condition is $u(0)=4$ . The initial-value problem to be solved is

du/dt=1-u/50, u(0)=4

The differential equation is a separable equation, so we can apply the five-step strategy for solution

Step 1. Setting 1 - u/50 = 0 gives $u=50$ as a constant solution. Since the initial amount of salt in the tank is 4 kilograms this solution does not apply

Step 2.Rewrite the equation as

du/dt=(50-u)/50

Then multiply both sides by dt and divide both sides by $50-u$

du/(50-u) = dt/50.

Step 3.Inteqrate both sides

∫du/(50-u) = ∫dt/50
-ln|50-u| = t/50 + C.

Step 4. Solve for $u(t)$

ln|50-u|=-t/50-C; e^ln|50-u|=e^-(t/50)-C; |50-u|=C₁e^-t/50

Eliminate the absolute value by allowing the constant to be either positive or negative

$$50-u=C_{1}e^{-t/50}.$$

Finally, solve for u(t) 

u(t)=50-C₁e⁻ᵗ/⁵⁰

Step 5. Solve for $C_1$

u(0)=50-C₁e⁻⁰/⁵⁰, 4=50-C₁, C₁=46

The solution to the initial value problem is u(t) = 50 - 46e^(-t/50) To find the limiting amount of salt in the tank,take the limit as I approaches infinity

lim<sub>l→∞</sub>u(t) = 50-46e⁻ᵗ/⁵⁰ = 50-46(0) = 50

Note that this was the constant solution to the differential equation. If the initial amount of salt in the tank is 50 kilograms, then it remains constant. If it starts at less than 50 kilograms, then it approaches 50 kilograms over time.

![](./images/f8GY5RZZnYI7tT7K7agNRB55WPWc9gISs.png)

A tank contains 3 kilograms of salt dissolved in 75 liters of water. A salt solution of 0.4 kg salt/L is pumpec 4.12 into the tank at a rate of 6 L/min and is drained at the same rate. Solve for the salt concentration at time f Assume the tank is well mixed at all times.

### Newton's law of cooling

Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of chanqe of an object's temperature is proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the ambient temperature (i.e., the temperature of its surroundings).If we let $T(t)$ represent the temperature of an object as a function of time, then 
dT/dt represents the rate at which that temperature changes.The temperature of the object's surroundings can be represented by $T_{s}$ . Then Newton's law of cooling can be written in the form

dT/dt=k(T(t)-Tₛ)

or simply

dT/dt = k(T - Tₛ).

The temperature of the object at the beginning of any experiment is the initial value for the initial-value problem. We cal this temperature $T_{0}.$ Therefore the initial-value problem that needs tobe solved takes the form

dT/dt=k(T-Tₛ), T(0)=T₀

where $k$ is a constant that needs to be either given or determined in the context of the problem.We use these equations in Example 4.13

# EXAMPLE 4.13

### Waiting for a Pizza to Cool

A pizza is removed from the oven after baking thoroughly, and the temperature of the pizza when it comes out of the

oven is 200°F .The temperature of the kitchen is 75°F ,and after 1 minute the temperature of the pizza is 190°F We would like to wait until the temperature of the pizza reaches 150°F before cutting and serving it (Eigure 4.17). How much longer will we have to wait?.

![](./images/fgNeABZbQiTvQsgfcDiTl2sYpcwhg4YTs.png)

Figure 4.17 From Newton's law of cooling, if the pizza cools. 10°F in 1 minute,how long before it cools to 150°F?

# $②$ Solution

The ambient temperature (surrounding temperature) is. 
75°F ,SO $T_s=75$ The temperature of the pizza when it comes out of the oven is 200°F , which is the initial temperature (i.e., initial value), so $T_{0}=200$ .Therefore Equation 4.4 becomes

dT/dt = k(T-75), T(0) = 200

To solve the differential eauation, we use the five-step techniaue for solving separable eauations

1.Setting the right-hand side equal to zero gives $T=75$ as a constant solution. Since the pizza starts at 200°F , this is not the solution we are seeking 2.Rewrite the differential equation by multiplying both sides by dt and dividing both sides by $T-75$
dT/(T-75) = kdt

3.Inteqrate both sides

∫dT/(T-75) = ∫kdt, ln|T-75| = kt + C

4.Solve for $T$ by first exponentiating both sides:

e^(ln|T-75|) = e^(kt+C) |T-75| = C₁e^(kt) T-75 = C₁e^(kt) T(t) = 75 + C₁e^(kt)

5.Solve for Cₗ by using the initial condition $T(0)=200$

0≡200!; T(t) = 75 + C₁eᵏᵗ; T(0) = 75 + C₁eᵏ⁽⁰⁾; 200 = 75 + C₁; C₁ = 125.

Therefore the solution to the initial-value problem is

$$T(t)=75+125e^{kt}.$$

To determine the value of $k$ ,we need to use the fact that after 1minute the temperature of thepizza is 190°F Therefore $T(1)=190$ . Substituting this information into the solution to the initial-value problem, we have

Note that dV/dt = A dh/dt ,where $AT$ is the cross-sectional area of the tank.Solve the resulting initial-value problem for the height of water, assuming a tankof radius 24√2 with a circular hole of radius 2 ft

# 4.4 The Logistic Equation.

## Learning Objectives

4.4.1Describe the concept of environmental carrying capacity in the logistic model of population growth 4.4.2 Draw a direction field for a logistic equation and interpret the solution curves 4.4.3Solve a logistic equation and interpret the results

Differential equations can be used to represent the size of a population as it varies over time. We saw this in an earlier chapter in the section on exponential growth and decay, which is the simplest model. A more realistic model includes other factors that affect the growth of the population. In this section, we study the logistic differential equation and see how it applies to the study of population dynamics in the context of biology

# Population Growth and Carrying Capacity

To model population growth using a differential equation, we first need to introduce some variables and relevant terms The variable t.will represent time. The units of time can be hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. Any given problem must specify the units used in that particular problem. The variable $P$ will represent population. Since the. population varies over time, it is understood to be a function of time. Therefore we use the notation $P(t)$ forthe population as a function of time.If $P(t)$ is adifferentiable function, then the first derivative dP/dt represents the instantaneousrate of change of the population as a function of time.

In Exponential Growth_and Decay, we studied the exponential growth and decay of populations and radioactive substances. An example of an exponential growth function is $P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}.$ In this function, $P(t)$ represents the population at timef, $P_{0}$ represents the initial population (population at time $t=0$ ),and the constant $r>0$ is called the growth rate.Figure 4.18shows a graph of $P(t)=100e^{0.03t}$ .Here $P_{0}=100$ and $r=0.03$

![](./images/fz4WxkgsZzv4WDgVW7yHrrSicaciDaGfc.png)
Figure 4.18An exponential growth model of population.

We can verify that the function. $P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}$ satisfies the initial-value problem

dP/dt=rP, P(0)=P₀

This differential equation has an interesting interpretation.The left-hand side represents the rate at which the population increases (or decreases). The right-hand side is equal to a positive constant multiplied by the current population. Therefore the differential equation states that the rate at which the population increases is proportional t the population at that point in time.Furthermore,it states that the constant of proportionality never changes

One problem with this function is its prediction that as time goes on, the population grows without bound. This is unrealistic in a real-world setting. Various factors limit the rate of growth of a particular population, including birth rate death rate, food supply, predators, and so on. The growth constant r usually takes into consideration the birth and death rates but none of the other factors, and it can be interpreted as a net (birth minus death) percent growth rate per unit time. A natural question to ask is whether the population growth rate stays constant, or whether it changes over time Biologists have found that in many biological systems, the population grows until a certain steady-state population is reached. This possibility is not taken into account with exponential growth. However, the concept of carrying capacity allows for the possibility that in a given area, only a certain number of a given organism or animal can thrive without running into resource issues

### Definition

The carrying capacity of an organism in a given environment isdefined to be the maximum population of that organism that the environment can sustain indefinitely

We use the variable $K$ to denote the carrying capacity.The growth rate is represented by the variable r.Using these variables, we can define the logistic differential equation.

### Definition

Let $K$ represent the carrying capacity for a particular organism in a given environment, and let r be a real number that represents the growth rate.The function P(t) represents the population of this organism as a function of time t, and the constant $P_0$ represents the initial population (population of the organism at time $t=0$ ). Then the logistic differential equation is

dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)

![](./images/f9TRm1UvRc0ufmFMF7GOf4O7A2AOZny4X.png)

### MEDIA

See this website (http://www.openstax.orq/l/20 loqisticEq) for more information on the loqistic equation

The logistic equation was first published by Pierre Verhulst in 1845. This differential equation can be coupled with the initial condition $P(0)=P_{0}$ to form an initial-value problem for $P(t)$

Suppose that the initial population is small relative to the carrying capacity. Then P/K is small, possibly close to zero. Thus, the quantity in parentheses on the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is close to 1, and the right-hand side of this equation is close to $rP$ If $r>0$ , then the population grows rapidly, resembling exponential growth.

However, as the population grows, the ratio P/K also grows, because $K$ is constant. If the population remains below the carrying capacity, then P/K is less than 1, so 1-P/K>0 . Therefore the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is still positive, but the quantity in parentheses gets smaller, and the growth rate decreases as a result. If $P=K$ then the right-hand side is equal to zero, and the population does not change

Now suppose that the population starts at a value higher than the carrying capacity. Then p/K>1 , and 1 - p/K < 0 . Then the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is negative, and the population decreases. As long as $P>K$ , the population decreases. It never actually reaches $K$ because dP/dt will get smaller and smalle,but the population approaches the carrying capacity as t approaches infinity. This analysis can be represented visually by way of a phase line. A phase line describes the general behavior of a solution to an autonomous differential equation, depending on the initial condition For the case of a carrying capacity in the logistic equation, the phase line is as shown in Figure 4.19

![](./images/f94G5DMPr2rNU6vsGtipU3agSiHGEY6Os.png)

Figure 4.19 A phase line for the differential equation dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)

This phase line shows that when $P$ is less than zero or greater than $K$ , the population decreases over time. When $P$ is between 0 and $K$ the population increases over time.

### EXAMPLE 4.14

Chapter Opener: Examining the Carrying Capacity of a Deer Population

![](./images/fdYxY3HVq8kOyEWV5rIZIF4lhHdCaDS4p.png)

Figure 4.20 (credit: modification of work by Rachel Kramer, Flickr)

Let's consider the population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the state of Kentucky. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFWR) sets guidelines for hunting and fishing in the state. Before the hunting season of 2004, it estimated a population of 900,000 deer. Johnson notes: *A deer population that has plenty to eat and is not hunted by humans or other predators will double every three years."(George Johnson,“The Problem of Exploding Deer Populations Has No Attractive Solutions," January 12, 2001, accessed April 9, 2015 http://www.txtwriter.com/onscience/Articles/deerpops.html.) This observation corresponds to a rate of increase r = ln(2)/3 = 0.2311 , so the approximate growth rate is 23.11% per year. (This assumes that the population grows exponentially, which is reasonable--at least in the short term--with plentiful food supply and no predators.) The KDFWR also reports deer population densities for 32 counties in Kentucky, the average of which is approximately 27 deer per square mile. Suppose this is the deer density for the whole state (39,732 square miles). The carrying capacity $K$ is 39,732 square miles times 27 deer per square mile, or 1,072,764 deer

a.For this application, we have $P_{0}=900,000$ $K=1,072,764$ ,and $r=0.2311$ . Substitute these values into Equation 4.8 and form the initial-value problem. b.Solve the initial-valueproblem from part a. C.According to this model, what will be the population in 3 years? Recall that the doubling time predicted by Johnsor for the deer population was 3 years. How do these values compare? d.Suppose the population managed to reach 1,200,000 deer What does the logistic equation predict will happen to the population in this scenario?

## $②$ Solution

a.The initial value problem is

dP/dt=0.2311P(1-P/1,072,764), P(0)=900,000.

b.The logistic equation is an autonomous differential equation, so we can use the method of separation of variables Step 1: Setting the right-hand side equal to zero gives $P=0$ and $P=1,072,764$ This means that if the population starts at zero it will never change, and if it starts at the carrying capacity, it will never change. Step 2: Rewrite the differential equation and multiply both sides by:
n and multiply both sides by. dP/dt = 0.2311P((1,072,764-P)/1,072,764) dP = 0.2311P((1,072,764-P)/1,072,764)dt.

Divide both sides by P(1,072,764 - P)

dP/(P(1072764 - P)) = 0.2311/1072764 dt

Solve the equation using partial fraction decomposition. ∫dP/(P(1072764-P)) = ∫0.2311/1072764 dt (1/1072764)∫(1/P + 1/(1072764-P))dP = 0.2311t/1072764 + C (1/1072764)(ln|P| - ln|1072764-P|) = 0.2311t/1072764 + C

Step 4: Multiply both sides by 1,072,764 and use the quotient rule for logarithms
ln|P/(1072764-P)| = 0.2311t + C₁

Here $C_{1}=1,072,764C$ .Next exponentiate both sides and eliminate the absolute value
te botri sides and emminate trie ab e^(ln|P/(1,072,764-P)|) = e^(0.2311t+C₁)|P/(1,072,764-P)| = C₂e^(0.2311t) P/(1,072,764-P) = C₂e^(0.2311t).

Here $C_{2}=e^{C_{1}}$ but after eliminating the absolute value, it can be negative as well. Now solve for:
P = 1,072,764C₂e^(0.2311t) - C₂Pe^(0.2311t); P(t) = 1,072,764C₂e^(0.2311t) / (1+C₂e^(0.2311t))

Step 5: To determine the value of $C_{2}$ , it is actually easier to go back a couple of steps to where $C_{2}$ was defined. Ir particular, use the equation
P/(1072764-P)=C₂e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ

The initial condition is $P(0)=900,000$ .Replace $P$ with 900,000 and t with zero

P/(1,072,764 - P) = C₂e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ; 900,000/(1,072,764 - 900,000) = C₂e⁰·²³¹¹(⁰); 900,000/172,764 = c₂; C₂ = 25,000/4,799 ≈ 5.209

Therefore

P(t) = 1072764(25000/4799)e^(0.2311t) / (1 + (25000/4799)e^(0.2311t)) = 1072764(25000)e^(0.2311t) / (4799 + 25000e^(0.2311t))

Dividing the numerator and denominator by 25,000 gives

P(t)=1072764e^(0.2311t)/(0.19196+e^(0.2311t))

c.Using this model we can predict the population in 3 years
c populatoin mis yeais. P(3)=(1,072,764e⁰·²³¹¹⁽³⁾)/(0.19196+e⁰·²³¹¹⁽³⁾)≈978,830 deer

This is far short of twice the initial population of 900,000. Remember that the doubling time is based on the assumption that the growth rate never changes, but the logistic model takes this possibility into account. d.If the population reached 1,200,000 deer, then the new initial-value problem would be
dP/dt=0.2311P(1-P/1,072,764), P(0)=1,200,000.

The general solution to the differential equation would remain the same
ation woula reman the saine. P(t) = 1072764C₂e^(0.2311t)/(1+C₂e^(0.2311t))

To determine the value of the constant, return to the equation
P/(1,072,764 - P) = C₂e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ

Substituting the values $t=0$ and $P=1,200,000$ youget
1,200,000, you get C₂e^(0.2311(0)) = 1,200,000/(1,072,764 - 1,200,000), C₂ = -100,000/10,603 ≈ -9.431

Therefore

P(t) = 1,072,764C₂e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ/(1+C₂e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ) = 1,072,764(-100,000/10,603)e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ/(1+(-100,000/10,603)e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ) = -107,276,400,000e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ/(100,000e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ-10,603) ≈ 10,117,551e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ/(9.43129e⁰·²³¹¹ᵗ-1).

## Solving the Logistic Differential Equation

The logistic differential equation is an autonomous differential equation, so we can use separation of variables to find the general solution, as we just did in Example 4.14

Step 1: Setting the right-hand side equal to zero leads to $P=0$ and $P=K$ as constant solutions. The first solution. indicates that when there are no orqanisms present,the population will never qrow.The second solution indicates that when the population starts at the carrying capacity, it will never change

Step 2: Rewrite the differential equation in the form

dP/dt=rP(K-P)/K

Then multiply both sides by dt and divide both sides by $P( K- P)$ . This leads to

dP/(P(K-P))=(r/K)dt

Multiply both sides of the equation by $K$ and integrate

∫K/(P(K-P))dP=∫rdt

The left-hand side of this equation can be integrated using partial fraction decomposition. We leave it to you to verify

that

K/(P(K-P)) = 1/P + 1/(K-P)

Then the equation becomes

∫(1/P + 1/(K-P))dP = ∫rdt; ln|P| - ln|K-P| = rt + C; ln|P/(K-P)| = rt + C 

Now exponentiate both sides of the equation to eliminate the natural logarithm

e^(ln|P/(K-P)|) = e^(rt+C); |P/(K-P)| = e^Ce^(rt)

We define Cₗ=eᶜ and,noting that $K$ $P>0$ and $P<K$ so that> O we can drop the absolute value sign, so that the equation becomes

P/(K-P) = C₁e^(rt)

To solve this equation for $P(t)$ , first multiply both sides by $K-P$ and collect the terms containing $P$ on theleft-hand side of the equation

P = C₁eʳᵗ(K - P); P = C₁Keʳᵗ - C₁Peʳᵗ; P + C₁Peʳᵗ = C₁Keʳᵗ

Next, factor $P$ from the left-hand side and divide both sides by the other factor

P(1+C₁e^(rt))=C₁Ke^(rt), P(t)=C₁Ke^(rt)/(1+C₁e^(rt))

The last step is to determine the value of $C_{1}.$ The easiest way to do this is to substitute $t=0$ and $P_{0}$ in place of $P$ ir Equation 4.9 and solve for $C_{1}$

P/(K-P) = C₁e^(rt), P₀/(K-P₀) = C₁e^(r(0)), c₁ = P₀/(K-P₀).

Finally, substitute the expression for $C_{1}$ into Equation 4.10

P(t) = (C₁Ke^(rt))/(1+C₁e^(rt)) = ((P₀/(K-P₀))Ke^(rt))/(1+(P₀/(K-P₀))e^(rt))

Now multiply the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side by $(K-P_{0})$ and simplify

P(t) = (P₀K e<sup>rt</sup>)/( (K-P₀) + P₀e<sup>rt</sup> )

We state this result as a theorem

### Theorem 4.2

### Solution of the Logistic Differential Equation

Consider the logistic differential equation subject to an initial population of $P_{0}$ with carrying capacity $K$ and growth rate r. The solution to the corresponding initial-value problem is given by

P(t) = P₀Ke^(rt) / (K - P₀ + P₀e^(rt))

Now that we have the solution to the initial-value problem, we can choose values for Pn,r, and $K$ and study the solution curve. For example, in Example 4.14 we used the values $r=0.2311$ $K=1,072,764$ , and an initial population of 900.000 deer This leads to the solution

P(t) = (P₀Ke^(rt))/((K-P₀)+P₀e^(rt)) = (900,000(1,072,764)e^(0.2311t))/((1,072,764-900,000)+900,000e^(0.2311t)) = (900,000(1,072,764)e^(0.2311t))/(172,764+900,000e^(0.2311t)).

Dividing top and bottom by 900,000 gives

P(t) = 1,072,764e<sup>0.2311t</sup> / (0.19196 + e<sup>0.2311t</sup>)

This is the same as the original solution. The graph of this solution is shown again in blue in Figure 4.23, superimposed over the graph of the exponential growth model with initial population 900.000 and growth rate 0.2311 (appearing in green). The red dashed line represents the carrying capacity, and is a horizontal asymptote for the solution to the logistic equation.

Figure 4.23 A comparison of exponential versus logistic growth for the same initial population of 900,000 organisms and growth rate of 23.11%

Working under the assumption that the population grows according to the logistic differential equation, this graph predicts that approximately 20 years earlier (1984), the growth of the population was very close to exponential. The net growth rate at that time would have been around 
23.1% per year. As time goes on, the two graphs separate. This. happens because the population increases, and the logistic differential equation states that the growth rate decreases as the population increases. At the time the population was measured (2004), it was close to carrying capacity, and the population was starting to level off.

The solution to the loqistic differential equation has a point of inflection.To find this point,set the second derivative equal to zero:

P(t) = P₀Ke^(rt)/((K-P₀)+P₀e^(rt))
P′(t) = rP₀K(K-P₀)e^(rt)/((K-P₀)+P₀e^(rt))²
P″(t) = r²P₀K(K-P₀)e^(rt)((K-P₀)-P₀e^(rt))/((K-P₀)+P₀e^(rt))³

Setting the numerator equal to zero,

r²P₀K(K-P₀)e^(rt)((K-P₀)-P₀e^(rt))=0.

As long as P₀≠K , the entire quantity before and including $e^{rt}$ is nonzero, so we can divide it out:

$$(K-P_0)-P_0e^{rt}=0.$$

Solving fort,

P₀eʳᵗ = K - P₀; eʳᵗ = (K - P₀)/P₀; ln eʳᵗ = ln((K - P₀)/P₀); rt = ln((K - P₀)/P₀); t = (1/r)ln((K - P₀)/P₀)

Notice that if $P_0>K$ , then this quantity is undefined, and the graph does not have a point of inflection. In the logistic graph, the point of inflection can be seen as the point where the graph changes from concave up to concave down. This is where the “leveling off" starts to occur, because the net growth rate becomes slower as the population starts to approach the carrying capacity

### STUDENT PROJECT

Student Project: Logistic Equation with a Threshold Population

An improvement to the logistic model includes a threshold population.The threshold population is defined to be the minimum population that is necessary for the species to survive. We use the variable $T$ torepresent the threshold population. A differential equation that incorporates both the threshold population $T$ and carrying capacity $K$ is

dP/dt = -rP(1-P/K)(1-P/T)

where r represents the growth rate, as before

1.The threshold population is useful to biologists and can be utilized to determine whether a given species should be placed on the endangered list. A qroup of Australian researchers say they have determined the thresholc

population for any species to survive: 5000 adults. (Catherine Clabby, “A Magic Number," American Scientist 98(1) 24, doi:10.1511/2010.82.24. accessed April 9, 2015, http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/a-magic number). Therefore we use $T=5000$ as the threshold population in this project. Suppose that the environmental carrying capacity in Montana for elk is 25,000. Set up Equation 4.12 using the carrying capacity of 25,000 and threshold population of 5000.Assume an annual net growth rate of 18% 2.Draw the direction field for the differential equation from step 1, along with several solutions for different initial populations. What are the constant solutions of the differential equation? What do these solutions correspond to in the original population model (i.e., in a biological context)? 3.What is the limiting population for each initial population you chose in step 2?(Hint: use the slope field to see what happens for various initial populations, i.e., look for the horizontal asymptotes of your solutions.) 4.This equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables. However, it is very difficult to get the solution as an explicit function of t. Using an initial population of 18,000 elk, solve the initial-value problem and express the solution as an implicit function of t, or solve the general initial-value problem, finding a solution in terms of r,K,T,and $P_0$

# 4.5 First-order Linear Equations

## Learning Objectives

4.5.1Write a first-order linear differential equation in standard form

4.5.2 Find an integrating factor and use it to solve a first-order linear differential equation 4.5.3 Solve applied problems involving first-order linear differential equations

Earlier, we studied an application of a first-order differential equation that involved solving for the velocity of an object In particular, if a ballis thrown upward with an initial velocity of υ₀ ft/s,then an initial-value problem that describes the velocity of theball afterf seconds is given by

dv/dt=-32, v(0)=v₀

This model assumes that the only force acting on the ballis gravity. Now we add to the problem by allowing for the possibility of air resistance acting on the ball

Air resistance always acts in the direction opposite to motion. Therefore if an object is rising, air resistance acts in a downward direction. If the object is falling, air resistance acts in an upward direction (Eigure 4.24). There is no exact relationship between the velocity of an object and the air resistance acting on it.For very small objects, air resistance is

proportional to velocity; that is, the force due to air resistance is numerically equal to some constant $k$ times υ .For larger (e.g., baseball-sized) objects, depending on the shape, air resistance can be approximately proportional to the square of the velocity.In fact, air resistance may be proportional to $v^{1.5}$, or υ⁰·⁹ or some other power of υ

![](./images/fIXihE37zC7HQFPN1UBdOy1G7GWUHM3aL.png)

Fiqure 4.24 Forces actinq on a movinq baseball: qravity acts in a downward direction and air resistance acts in a directior opposite to the direction of motion.

We will work with the linear approximation for air resistance. If we assume $k>0$ ,then the expression for the force $F_{A}$ due to air resistance is given by $F_{A}=-kv.$ Therefore the sum of the forces acting on the object is equal to the sum of the gravitational force and the force due to air resistance. This, in turn, is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration at time f (Newton's second law).This gives us the differential equatior


m(dv/dt)=-kv-mg

Finally, we impose an initial condition v(0) = v₀ ,where $U0$ is the initial velocity measured in meters per second. This makes $g= 9. 8$ m/s² . The initial-value problem becomes

mdv/dt=-kv-mg, v(0)=v₀

The differential eguation in this initial-value problem is an example of a first-order linear differential eguation, (Recall that a differential equation is first-order if the highest-order derivative that appears in the equation is 1.) In this section, we study first-order linear equations and examine a method for finding a qeneral solution to these types of equations,as well as solving initial-value problems involving them.

### Definition

A first-order differential equation is linear if it can be written in the form

a(x)y' + b(x)y = c(x)

where a(x), b(x) and c(x) are arbitrary functions of X

Remember that the unknown function $y$ depends on the variable $x$ that is, $X$ is the independent variable and $y$ is the dependent variable. Some examples of first-order linear differential equations are

(3x²-4)y' + (x-3)y = sinx
(sinx)y' - (cosx)y = cotx
4xy' + (3lnx)y = x³ - 4x

Examples of first-order nonlinear differential equations include

(y′)⁴-(y′)³=(3x-2)(y+4), 4y'+3y³=4x-5, (y′)²=sin y+cos x

These equations are nonlinear because of termslike (y')⁴, y³, etc. Due to these terms, it is impossible to put these equations into the same form as Equation 4.14.

### Standard Form

Consider the differential equation

(3x²-4)y'+(x-3)y=sin x

Our main goal in this section is to derive a solution method for equations of this form. It is useful to have the coefficient of y' be equal to 1. To make this happen, we divide both sides by $3x^{2}-4$

y'+((x-3)/(3x²-4))y=sin x/(3x²-4)

This is called the standard form of the differential equation.We will use it later when finding the solution to a general first-order linear differential equation. Returning to Equation 4.14, we can divide both sides of the equation by a(x) This leads to the equation

y'+b(x)/a(x)y=c(x)/a(x)

Now define p(x) = b(x)/a(x) and q(x) = c(x)/a(x)  Then Equation 4.14 becomes

$$y'+p(x)y=q(x).$$

We can write any first-order linear differentialeauationin this form.and this is referred to as the standard form for first-order linear differential equation.

## EXAMPLE 4.15

## Writing First-Order Linear Equations in Standard Form

Put each of the following first-order linear differential equations into standard form. Identify p(x) and $q(x)$ for each equation.

a. y′=3x-4y b. 3xy'/ (4y - 3) = 2 (here x≠0 C. y = 3y' - 4x² + 5

## $①$ Solution

a.Add $4y$ to both sides:

y'+4y=3x

In this equation, p(x) = 4 and $q(x)=3x$

b.Multiply both sides by $4y-3$ , then subtract $8y$ from each side:
oy ilun eau ISIUC (3xy′)/(4y-3) = 2; 3xy′ = 2(4y-3); 3xy′ = 8y-6; 3xy′-8y = -6.

Finally, divide both sides by $3x$ to make the coefficient of y' equal to 1:
y' - (8/(3x))y = -2/x

This is allowable because in the original statement of this problem we assumed that x≠0 (If $x=0$ then the original equation becomes 0=2 ,which is clearly a false statement.) In this equation, p(x)=-8/(3x) and q(x) = -2/x

c.Subtract $y$ from each side and add $4x^{2}-5$

$$3y'-y=4x^{2}-5.$$

Next divide both sides by 3:

y' - (1/3)y = (4/3)x² - (5/3)

In this equation, p(x) = -1/3 and q(x) = (4/3)x² - 5/3.

![](./images/flaPD1vEbsG6Vn93q8Rfmd0zmpsBTiUSH.png)

Put the equation ,(x+3)y = 5 into standard form and identify p(x) and q(x)

# Integrating Factors

We now develop a solution technique for any first-order linear differential equation. We start with the standard form of a first-order linear differential equation:

y'+p(x)y=q(x).

The first term on the left-hand side of Equation 4.15 is the derivative of the unknown function, and the second term is the product of a known function with the unknown function. This is somewhat reminiscent of the product rule from the Differentiation Rules (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-3-differentiation-rules) section. If we multiply Equation 4.16 by a yet-to-be-determined function μ(x) ,then the equation becomer

μ(x)y' + μ(x)p(x)y = μ(x)q(x).

The left-hand side Eauation 4.18 can be matched perfectly to the product rule:

d/dx[f(x)g(x)]=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)

Matching term by term gives y = f(x), g(x) = μ(x) , and 
g'(x) = μ(x)p(x) Taking the derivative of g(x)=μ(x) and setting it equal to the right-hand side of g'(x)=μ(x)p(x) leads to

μ'(x)=μ(x)p(x).

This is a first-order, separable differential equation for μ(x) We know $p(x)$ because it appears in the differential equation we are solving. Separating variables and integrating yields

μ'(x)/μ(x) = p(x)  ∫μ'(x)/μ(x)dx = ∫p(x)dx  ln|μ(x)| = ∫p(x)dx+C  e^ln|μ(x)| = e^∫p(x)dx+C  |μ(x)| = C₁e^∫p(x)dx  μ(x) = C₂e^∫p(x)dx.

Here $C_{2}$ can be an arbitrary (positive or negative) constant. This leads to a general method for solving a first-order linear differential equation. We first multiply both sides of Equation 4.16 by the integrating factor μ(x) .This gives

μ(x)y' + μ(x)p(x)y = μ(x)q(x).

The left-hand side of Equation 4.20 can be rewritten as d/dx(μ(x) $y)$

d/dx(μ(x)y) = μ(x)q(x)

Next inteqrate both sides of Equation 4.21 with respect to $X$

∫(d/dx)(μ(x)y) dx = ∫μ(x)q(x) dx; μ(x)y = ∫μ(x)q(x) dx

Divide both sides of Equation 4.22 by μ(x)

y = 1/μ(x)[∫μ(x)q(x)dx + C]

Since μ(x) was previously calculated, we are now finished. An important note about the integrating constant C : It may seem that we are inconsistent in the usage of the integrating constant. However, the integral involving p(x) is necessary in order to find an integrating factor for Equation 4.15. Only one integrating factor is needed in order to solve the equation; therefore,it is safe to assign a value for $C$ for this integral.We chose $C=0$ .When calculating the integral inside the brackets in Equation 4.21, it is necessary to keep our options open for the value of the integrating constant because our goal is to find a general family of solutions to Equation 4.15. This integrating factor guarantees just that.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

### Solving a First-order Linear Differential Equation

1.Put the equation into standard form and identify p(x) and $q(x)$

2. Calculateth integratin fator μ(x) = e∫p(x) dx 3.Multiply both sides of the differential equation by μ(x) 4. Integrate both sides of the equation obtained in step 3, and divide both sides by μ(x) 5.If there is an initial condition,determine thevalue of $C$

# EXAMPLE 4.16

### Solving a First-order Linear Equation Find a general solution for the differential equation xy'+3y=4x²-3x Assume $x>0$

![](./images/fhs8ZtM2IDuXYqqalQATCHeMqmkAxQ7gx.png)

1.To put this differential equation into standard form,divide both sides by $x$
y'+(3/x)y=4x-3.

Therefore p(x)=3/x and $q(x)=4x-3$ 2. The inegratin factoris μ(x) = e^∫(3/x)dx = e^(3lnx) = x³

3.Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by μ(x) gives us

Equation by μ(x) gives us: x³y'+x³(3/x)y = x³(4x-3); x³y'+3x²y = 4x⁴-3x³; d/dx(x³y) = 4x⁴-3x³.

4.Integrate both sides of the equation

∫(d/dx)(x³y)dx = ∫4x⁴-3x³dx; x³y = (4x⁵)/5 - (3x⁴)/4 + C; y = (4x²)/5 - (3x)/4 + Cx⁻³

5.There is no initial value, so the problem is complete.

### ® Analysis

You may have noticed the condition that was imposed on the differential equation; namely, $x>0$ For any nonzero value of $C$ , the general solution is not defined at $x=0$ . Furthermore, when $x<0$ , the integrating factor changes. The

integrating factor is given by Equation 4.19 as f(x) = e∫p(x)dx .For this p(x) weger

e^∫p(x)dx = e^∫(3/x)dx = e^(3ln|x|) = |x|³

since $x<0$ .The behavior of the general solution changes at $x=0$ largely due to the fact that p(x) is not defined there

4.16 Find the general solution to the differential equation (x-2)y'+y=3x²+2x Assume x > 2

Now we use the same strateay to find the solution to an initial-value problem

### EXAMPLE 4.17

### A First-order Linear Initial-Value Problem

Solve the initial-value problem

 y'+3y=2x-1, y(0)=3. 

### Solution

1.This differential equation is already in standard form with p(x) = 3 and q(x)=2x-1 2. The integraing fatoris μ(x) = e^∫3dx = e³ˣ 3.Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by μ(x) gives
equation of μ(x) gives e³ˣy' + 3e³ˣy = (2x-1)e³ˣ; d/dx[ye³ˣ] = (2x-1)e³ˣ.

Integrate both sides of the equation

∫(d/dx)[ye³ˣ]dx = ∫(2x - 1)e³ˣdx; ye³ˣ = (e³ˣ/3)(2x - 1) - ∫(2/3)e³ˣdx; ye³ˣ = (e³ˣ(2x - 1))/3 - (2e³ˣ)/9 + C; y = (2x - 1)/3 - 2/9 + Ce⁻³ˣ; y = (2x)/3 - 5/9 + Ce⁻³ˣ

4.Now substitute $x=0$ and $y=3$ into the general solution and solve for $C$
meralsolution and solve lot C; y = (2/3)x - 5/9 + Ce⁻³ˣ; 3 = (2/3)(0) - 5/9 + Ce⁰; 3 = -5/9 + C; C = 32/9

Therefore the solution to the initial-value problem is

y = (2/3)x - 5/9 + (32/9)e⁻³ˣ

## Applications of First-order Linear Differential Equations

We look at two different applications of first-order linear differential equations. The first involves air resistance as it relates to objects that are rising or falling; the second involves an electrical circuit. Other applications are numerous, but most are solved in a similar fashion

## Free fall with air resistance

We discussed air resistance at the beginning of this section. The next example shows how to apply this concept for a ball in vertical motion. Other factors can affect the force of air resistance, such as the size and shape of the object, but we iqnore themhere

## EXAMPLE 4.18

### A Ball with Air Resistance

A racquetballis hit straight upward with an initial velocity of $2m/s$ The mass of a racquetballis approximately 0.0427 kg Air resistance acts on the ball with a force numerically equal to $0.5v$, where υ represents the velocity of the ball at time 1.

a.Find thevelocity of theball asa function of time b.How long does it take for the ball to reach its maximum height c.If the ball is hit from an initial height of 1 meter, how high will it reach?

## $②$ Solution

a.The mass $m=0.0427$ kg$,k=0.5$ , and $g= 9. 8$ m/s² The initial velocity is $v_{0}=2$ m/s. Therefore the initial-value problem is
0.0427(dv/dt) = -0.5v - 0.0427(9.8), v₀ = 2

Dividing the differential equation by 0.0427 gives

dv/dt = -11.7096v - 9.8, v₀ = 2.

The differential equation is linear. Using the problem-solving strategy for linear differential equations

Step 1. Rewrite the differential equation as dv/dt + 11.7096v = -9.8 This gives p(t)=11.7096 and q(t)=-9.8

Step 2. Theintegrating factor is μ(t)=e∫¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶dt=e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ

Step 3. Multiply the differential equation by μ(t)
equation uy μ(t). e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ dv/dt + 11.7096ve¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ = -9.8e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ; d/dt[ve¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ] = -9.8e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ.

Step 4. Inteqrate both sides

∫(d/dt)[ve¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ]dt = ∫-9.8e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗdt; ve¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ = (-9.8/11.7096)e¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ + C; v(t) = -0.8369 + Ce⁻¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ

Step 5. Solve for $C$ using the initial condition uo =v(O) = 2:
dition v₀=v(0)=2: v(t) = -0.8369+Ce⁻¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ v(0) = -0.8369+Ce⁻¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶(0) 2 = -0.8369+C C = 2.8369.

Therefore the solutionto the initial-value problem is v(t) = 2.8369e⁻¹¹.⁷⁰⁹⁶ᵗ - 0.8369 b.The ball reaches its maximum height when the velocity is equal to zero. The reason is that when the velocity is

positive, it is rising, and when it is negative, it is falling. Therefore when it is zero, it is neither rising nor falling, anc. is at its maximum height:



where $R$ is a constant of proportionality called the resistance, and $i$ is the current 2.The voltage drop across an inductor is given by
Eₗ=Li'

where $L$ is a constant of proportionality called the inductance, and $i$ again denotes the current 3.The voltage drop across a capacitor is given by
E<sub>C</sub>=q/C

where $C$ is a constant of proportionality called the capacitance, and $q$ is theinstantaneous charge on the capacitor.The relationship between i and $q$ is i=q'

We use units of volts (V) to measure voltage $E$ , amperes (A) to measure current i, coulombs (C) to measure charge $q$ ohms (Ω) to measure resistance $R$ ,henrys (H) to measure inductance $L.$ and farads (F) to measure capacitance $C$ Consider the circuit in Fiqure 4.25

![](./images/fAP3OgWdRUQ0EXncgwDoyEEcP0KKLOrq3.png)

Figure 4.25 A typical electric circuit, containing a voltage generator $(V_S)$ , capacitor $(C)$ , inductor $(L)$ ,and resistor $(R)$

Applying Kirchhoff's Loop Rule to this circuit, we let $E$ denote the electromotive force supplied by the voltage generator Then

$$E_L+E_R+E_C=E.$$

Substituting the expressions for $E_L,E_R$ , and $E_{C}$ into this equation, we obtain

L'i+Ri+1/Cq=E.

If there is no capacitor in the circuit, then the equation becomes

$$Li'+Ri=E.$$

This is a first-order differential equation in i. The circuit is referred to as an $LR$ circuit.

Next, suppose there is no inductor in the circuit, but there is a capacitor and a resistor, so $L=0$ R ≠ 0 , and C≠0  .Then Fquation 4.23 can be rewritten as.

Rq' + q/C = E

which is a first-orderlinear differential equation.This isreferred to as an $RC$ circuit.In either case,we can set up and solve an initial-value problem

## EXAMPLE 4.19

## Finding Current in an RL Electric Circuit

A circuit has in series an electromotive force given by E=50sin20t V a resistor of 5Ω, and an inductor of $0.4H.$ If the initial current is O,find the current at time $t>0$

# $②$ Solution

We have a resistor and an inductor in the circuit, so we use Equation 4.24. The voltage drop across the resistor is given by $E_{R}=Ri=5i$ The voltage drop across the inductor is given by Eₗ = Li' = 0.4i' . The electromotive force becomes the riqht-hand side of Equation 4.24. Therefore Equation 4.24 becomes

0.4i'+5i=50sin20t

Dividinq both sides by 0.4 qives the equation.

i' + 12.5i = 125sin20t.

Since the initial current is O, this result gives an initial condition of 
i(0)=0 We can solve this initial-value problem using the five-step strategy for solving first-order differential equations.

Step 1.Rewrite the differential equation as 
i'+12.5i=125sin20t This gives p(t) = 12.5 and q(t)=125sin20t

Step 2 Th integratingfactoris 
μ(t) = e^∫12.5dt = e^(12.5t)

Step 3. Multiply the differential equation by μ(t)

e¹²⋅⁵ᵗi'+12.5e¹²⋅⁵ᵗi=125e¹²⋅⁵ᵗsin20t; d/dt[ie¹²⋅⁵ᵗ]=125e¹²⋅⁵ᵗsin20t

Step 4.Integrate both sides:

∫(d/dt)[ie¹²·⁵ᵗ]dt = ∫12.5e¹²·⁵ᵗsin20t dt; ie¹²·⁵ᵗ = (250sin20t - 400cos20t)/89 e¹²·⁵ᵗ + C; i(t) = (250sin20t - 400cos20t)/89 + Ce⁻¹²·⁵ᵗ

Step 5. Solve for $C$ using the initial condition v(0)=2
i(t) = (250sin20t - 400cos20t)/89 + Ce⁻¹²⋅⁵ᵗ, i(0) = (250sin(0) - 400cos(0))/89 + Ce⁰, 0 = -400/89 + C, C = 400/89

Therefore the solution to the initial-value problem is
i(t)=(250sin20t-400cos20t+400e⁻¹²⋅⁵ᵗ)/89=(250sin20t-400cos20t)/89+(400e⁻¹²⋅⁵ᵗ)/89.

The first term can be rewritten as a single cosine function. First, multiply and divide by √(250²+400²)=50√89

(250sin20t-400cos20t)/89 = (50√89)/89((250sin20t-400cos20t)/(50√89)) = -(50√89)/89(8cos20t/√89 - 5sin20t/√89)

Next, define φ to be an acute angle such that cosp = . Then sin = an

-(50√89)/89(8cos20t/√89 - 5sin20t/√89) = -(50√89)/89(cosφcos20t - sinφsin20t) = -(50√89)/89cos(20t+φ)

Therefore the solution can be written as

i(t)=-50√89/89cos(20t+φ)+400e⁻¹²⋅⁵ᵗ/89.

The second term is called the attenuation term, because it disappears rapidly as t grows larger. The phase shift is given by φ and the amplitude of the steady-statecurrent isgiven by 50√89/89 . The graph of this solution appears in Fiqure 4.26

## Introduction

The Koch snowflake is constructed from an infinite number of nonoverlapping equilateral triangles. Consequently, we can express its area as a sum of infinitely many terms. How do we add an infinite number of terms? Can a sum of an infinite number of terms be finite? To answer these questions, we need to introduce the concept of an infinite series, a sum with infinitely many terms. Having defined the necessary tools, we will be able to calculate the area of the Koch snowflake (see Example 5.8)

The topic of infinite series may seem unrelated to differential and integral calculus. In fact, an infinite series whose terms involve powers of a variable is a powerful tool that we can use to express functions as *infinite polynomials." We can use infinite series to evaluate complicated functions, approximate definite integrals, and create new functions. In addition, infinite series are used to solve differential equations that model physical behavior, from tiny electronic circuits to Earth orbiting satellites.

5.1.1Find the formula for the general term of a sequence. 5.1.2 Calculate the limit of a sequence if it exists.

5.1.3 Determine the convergence or divergence of a given sequence

In this section,we introduce sequences and define what it means for a sequence to converqe or diverqe.We show how to find limits of sequences that converge, often by using the properties of limits for functions discussed earlier. We close this section with the Monotone Convergence Theorem, a tool we can use to prove that certain types of sequences converge

# Terminology of Sequences

To work with this new topic, we need some new terms and definitions. First, an infinite sequence is an ordered list of numbers of the form

a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ, ...

Each of the numbersin thesequence is called a term.Thesymbol $n$ is called the index variable for the sequence. We use the notation

{aₙ}ₙ₌₁^∞, or {aₙ}

to denote this sequence.A similar notation is used for sets, but a sequence is an ordered list, whereas a set is not ordered. Because a particular number $a_n$ exists for each positive integer $n$ , we can also define a sequence as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.

Let's consider the infinite, ordered list.

2,4,8,16,32.

This is a sequence in which the first, second, and third terms are given by $a_{1}=2,a_{2}=4$ ,and $a_{3}=8$ You can probably see that the terms in this sequence have the following pattern

a₁=2¹, a₂=2², a₃=2³, a₄=2⁴, and a₅=2⁵.

Assuming this pattern continues, we can write the nth term in the sequence by the explicit formula $a_{n}=2^{n}.$ Using this notation, we can write this sequence as

{2ⁿ}ₙ₌₁∞ or {2ⁿ}

Alternatively, we can describe this sequence in a different way. Since each term is twice the previous term, this sequence can be defined recursively by expressing the nth term $a_n$ in terms of the previous term $a_{n-1}$ . In particular, we can define this sequence as the sequence {aₙ} where $a_{1}=2$ and for all n ≥ 2 ,each term $a_{n}$ is defined by the recurrence relation $a_{n}=2a_{n-1}$

## Definition

An infinite sequence {aₙ} is an ordered list of numbers of the form

$$a_1,a_2,...,a_n,....$$

The subscript n is called the index variable of the sequence.Each number $a_{n}$ is a term of the sequence. Sometimes sequences are defined by explicit formulas, in which case $a_{n}=f(n)$ for some function $f(n)$ defined over the positive integers. In other cases, sequences are defined by using a recurrence relation. In a recurrence relation, one term (or more) of the sequence is given explicitly, and subsequent terms are defined in terms of earlier terms in the sequence.

Note that the index does not have to start at $n=1$ but could start with other integers. For example, a sequence given by the explicit formula $a_{n}=f(n)$ could start at $n=0$ , in which case the sequence would be

a₀, a₁, a₂, ...

Similarly, for a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, the term $a_0$ may be given explicitly, and the terms $a_n$ for n≥1

may be defined in terms of $a_{n-1}$ . Since a sequence {aₙ} has exactly one value for each positive integer $n$ it can be described as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. As a result, it makes sense to discuss the graph of a sequence. The graph of a sequence {aₙ} consists of all points $(n,a_n)$ for all positive integers n. Figure 5.2 shows the graph of {2ⁿ}

![](./images/fyk4Nfzrnz72ngxNhfZ16Rpu6BfnfTSrU.png)
Figure 5.2 The plotted points are a graph of the sequence {2ⁿ}

Two types of sequences occur often and are given special names: arithmetic sequences and geometric sequences. In an arithmetic sequence,the difference between every pair of consecutive terms is the same.For example,consider the sequence

3,7, 11, 15, 19,.

You can see that the difference between every consecutive pair of terms is 4. Assuming that this pattern continues, this sequence is an arithmetic sequence. It can be described by using the recurrence relation

a₁ = 3, aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + 4 for n ≥ 2

Note that

a₂ =3+4, a₃ =3+4+4=3+2⋅4, a₄ =3+4+4+4=3+3⋅4.

Thus the sequence can also be described using the explicit formula

aₙ = 3 + 4(n-1) = 4n - 1

In general, an arithmetic sequence is any sequence of the form $a_{n}=cn+b$

In a geometric sequence, the ratio of every pair of consecutive terms is the same.For example,consider the sequence

2, -2/3, 2/9, -2/27, 2/81, …

We see that the ratio of any term to the preceding term is -1/3. Assuming this pattern continues, this sequence is a geometric sequence.It can be defined recursively as

a₁=2; aₙ=-(1/3)aₙ₋₁ for n≥2

Alternatively, since

a₂ = (-1/3)⋅2, a₃ = (-1/3)²⋅2, a₄ = (-1/3)³⋅2

we see that the sequence can be described by usinq the explicit formula

aₙ=2(-1/3)ⁿ⁻¹

The sequence {2ⁿ} that we discussed earlier is a geometric sequence, where the ratio of any term to the previous term is 2. In general, a geometric sequence is any sequence of the form $a_{n}=cr^{n}$

# EXAMPLE 5.1

### Finding Explicit Formulas

Foreach of the following sequences,find an explicit formula for the nth term of the sequence

a.-13-4- b. 3/4, 9/7, 27/10. 243/16, …

## $②$ Solution

a.First, note that the sequence is alternating from negative to positive. The odd terms in the sequence are negative and the even terms are positive. Therefore, the nth term includes a factor of $(-1)^n$ . Next, consider the sequence of numerators {1,2,3,...} and the sequence of denominators {2, 3, 4,...). We can see that both of these sequences are arithmetic sequences.The nth term in the sequence of numerators is $n$ ,and the nth term in the sequence of denominators is $n+1$ Therefore, the sequence can be described by the explicit formula
aₙ = (-1)^n n/(n+1)

b.The sequence of numerators 3, 9,27,81,243... is a geometric sequence.The numerator of the nth term is $3^n$ The sequence of denominators 4, 7, 10,13,16,... is an arithmetic sequence.The denominator of the nth term is 4+3(n-1) = 3n+1. Therefore, we can describe the sequence by the explicit formula a, =3

5.1 Find an explit formula for the nth term of the sequence {1/5, -1/7, 1/9, -1/11,…},

# EXAMPLE 5.2

### Defined by Recurrence Relations

For each of the following recursively defined sequences,find an explicit formula for the sequence

a. $a_{1}=2$ $a_{n}=-3a_{n-1}$ for n ≥ 2 b. a₁ = 1/2, aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + (1/2)ⁿ for n ≥ 2

## $②$ Solution

a.Writing out the first few terms, we have

a₁=2, a₂=-3a₁=-3(2), a₃=-3a₂=(-3)²2, a₄=-3a₃=(-3)³2

In general,

$$a_{n}=2(-3)^{n-1}.$$

b.Write out the first few terms

a = 1/2, a₂ = a₁ + (1/2)² = 3/4, a₃ = a₂ + (1/2)³ = 7/8, a₄ = a₃ + (1/2)⁴ = 15/16

From this pattern, we derive the explicit formula

aₙ = (2ⁿ - 1)/2ⁿ = 1 - 1/2ⁿ.

5.2 Find an explicit formula for the sequence defined recursively such that $a_1=-4$ and $a_{n}=a_{n-1}+6.$

## Limit of a Sequence

A fundamental question that arises regarding infinite sequences is the behavior of the terms as $n$ gets larger. Since sequence is a function defined on the positive integers, it makes sense to discuss the limit of the terms as n→cos(-1) . Fo example,consider the following four sequences and their different behaviors as n → 00 (see Fiqure 5.3)

a. {1+3n}={4,7,10,13,…} The terms $1+3n$ become arbitrarily large as n→∞ In this case, we say that 1 + 3n → ∞ as n→∞
{1-(1/2)^n}={1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16,...}. The terms 1-(1/2)^n→1 as n→∞.
C. {(-1)ⁿ} = {-1, 1, -1, 1, ...} The terms alternate but do not approach one single value as n→∞ d. {-1, 1/2, -1/3, 1/4, …} The terms alternate for this sequence as well but (-1)ⁿ/n → 0 as n→∞

![](./images/fQYxbIGLhfRxPI4nCUkXdEeVcf6t3hiKU.png)
Figure 5.3 (a) The terms in the sequence become arbitrarily large as n→∞ - (b) The terms in the sequence approach 1 as

n→∞ (c) The terms in the sequence alternate between 1 and -1 as n→∞ (d) The terms in the sequence alternate between positive and negative values but approach 0 as n→∞

From these examples, we see several possibilities for the behavior of the terms of a sequence as n→∞ In two of the sequences, the terms approach a finite number as n→∞ . In the other two sequences, the terms do not. If the terms of a sequence approach a finite number $L$ as n→∞ ,we say that the sequence is a convergent sequence and the real number $L$ is the limit of the sequence. We can give an informal definition here.

### Definition

Given a sequence {aₙ}, if the terms $a_{n}$ become arbitrarily close to a finite number $L$ as n becomes sufficiently large we say {aₙ} is a convergent sequence and $L$ is the limit of the sequence. In this case, we write

limₙ→∞ aₙ = L.

If a sequence {aₙ} is not convergent, we say it is a divergent sequence

From Eigure 5.3, we see that the terms in the sequence {1-(1/2)^n} are becoming arbitrarily close to 1 as $n$ becomes very large. We conclude that {1-(1/2)^n} is a convergent sequence and its limit is 1. In contrast, from Figure 5.3, we see that the terms in the sequence $1+3n$ are not approaching a finite number as. $n$ becomes larger. We say that {1+3n} is a divergent sequence.

In the informal definition for the limit of a sequence, we used the terms “arbitrarily close” and “sufficiently large."

Although these phrases help illustrate the meaning of a converging sequence, they are somewhat vague. To be more precise, we now present the more formal definition of limit for a sequence and show these ideas graphically in Eiqure 5.4.

## Definition

A sequence {aₙ} converges to a real number $L$ if for all 
ε>0 there exists an integer $N$ such that |aₙ-L|<ε if n≥N The number $L$ is the limit of the sequence and we write

limₙ→∞ aₙ = L or aₙ → L

 In this case, we say the sequence {aₙ} is a convergent sequence. If a sequence does not converge, it is a divergent sequence, and we say the limit does not exist.

We remark that the convergence or divergence of a sequence {aₙ} depends only on what happens to the terms $a_n$ as n→∞ .Therefore,if a finite number of terms b₁, b₂, …, bₙ are placed before $a_1$ to create a new sequence

$$b_1,b_2,...,b_N,a_1,a_2,...,$$

this new sequence will converge if {aₙ} converges and diverge if {aₙ} diverges. Further, if the sequence {aₙ} converges to $L$ , this new sequence will also converge to $L$

![](./images/fhK9BAoSBAW3Bg0Eg3kktmiEuhhGiqgEN.png)
Figure 5.4 As n increases, the terms $a_n$ become closer to L. For values of n≥N the distance between each point $(n,a_n)$

and the line $y=L$ is less than ε

As defined above, if a sequence does not converge, it is said to be a divergent sequence. For example, the sequences {1+3n} and {(-1)^n} shown in Figure 5.4 diverge. However, different sequences can diverge in different ways. The sequence {(-1)^n} diverges because the terms alternate between I and -1 ,but do not approach one value as n→∞ On the other hand, the sequence {1+3n} diverges because the terms 1 + 3n → ∞ as n→∞ .We say the sequence {1+3n} diverges to infinity and write lim(1+3n) = ∞ It is important to recognize that this notation does not imply /1→ 00

the limit of the sequence {1+3n} exists. The sequence is, in fact, divergent. Writing that the limit is infinity is intended only to provide more information about why the sequence is divergent. A sequence can also diverge to negative infinity For example, the sequence {-5n+2} diverges to negative infinity because -5n + 2 → -∞ as n→∞ . We write this as
lim_(n→∞)(-5n+2) = -∞

Because a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers, we can use properties of limits of

functions to determine whether a sequence converges. For example, consider a sequence {aₙ} and arelated function $f$ defined on all positivereal numbers such that $f(n)=a_{n}$ for all integers n≥1 Since the domain of the sequence is a subset of the domain of $f$ , if lim $f(x)$ exists, then the sequence converges and has the same limit. For example. X→00

consider the sequence {1/n} and the related function f(x) = 1/x -  Since the function $f$ defined on all real numbers $x>0$ satisfies f(x)=1/x→0 as x→∞ ,the sequence {1/n} must satisfy 1/n → 0 as n→∞

## Theorem 5.1

Limit of a Sequence Defined by a Function

Consider a sequence {aₙ} such that $a_{n}=f(n)$ for all n≥1 If there exists a real number $L$ such that

lim_(x→∞)f(x)=L

then {aₙ} converges and

limₙ→∞ aₙ = L.

We can use this theorem to evaluate lim rⁿ for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 .For example, consider the sequence $(1/2)^n$ }and the related FI→ 00 exponential function $f( x) = ( 1/ 2) ^{x}$ . Since lim(1/2)^x = 0 , we conclude that the sequence {(1/2)ⁿ }converges and its X→0 limit is 0. Similarly, for any real number r such that 0≤r<1 ,lim $r^{X}=0$ ,and therefore the sequence {rⁿ} converges 0 ≤ r < 1, lim<sub>r→∞</sub>rˣ = 0 On the otherhand, if $r=1$ .then lim r<sup>x</sup>=1 , and thefoe the limit o the sequene {1ⁿ} is 1. f $r>1$ r>1 r > 1, limₓ→∞ rˣ = ∞ h,and therefore we cannot apply this theorem. However, in this case, just as the function $r^x$ grows without bound as n→∞ the terms $r^{H}$ in the sequence become arbitrarily large as n→∞ , and we conclude that the sequence {rⁿ} diverges to infinity if $r>1$

We summarize these results regarding the geometric sequence {rⁿ} :

rⁿ→0 if 0 < r < 1; rⁿ→1 if r = 1; rⁿ→∞ if r > 1.

Later in this section we consider the case when $r<0$

We now consider slightly more complicated sequences.For example, consider the sequence {(2/3)^n+(1/4)^n} .The terms in this sequence are more complicated than other sequences we have discussed, but luckily the limit of this sequence is determined by the limits of the two sequences {(2/3)ⁿ} and {(1/4)ⁿ} As we describe in the following algebraic limit laws, since {(2/3)ⁿ} and (1/4)ⁿ both converge to O, the sequence {(2/3)^n+(1/4)^n} converges to 0+0=0 . Just as we were able to evaluate a limit involving an algebraic combination of functions $f$ and $g$ by looking at the limits of $f$ and $g$ (see Introduction to Limits (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/2-introduction), we are able to evaluate the limit of a sequence whose terms are algebraic combinations of $a_n$ and $b_{n}$ by evaluating the limits of {aₙ} and {bₙ}

## Theorem 5.2

### Algebraic Limit Laws

Given sequences {aₙ} and {bₙ} and any real number c, if there exist constants $A$ and $B$ such that lim aₙ = A and →00

lin $1b_n=B$ ,then

→ 00

lim(c)=c, lim(caₙ)=c lim(aₙ)=cA, lim(aₙ±bₙ)=lim(aₙ)±lim(bₙ)=A±B, lim(aₙ·bₙ)=lim(aₙ)·lim(bₙ)=A·B, lim(aₙ/bₙ)=lim(aₙ)/lim(bₙ)=A/B, provided B≠0

### Proof

We prove part i.

Let ϵ>0 Since lim $a_n=A$ ,there exists a constant positive integer $N_{1}$ such that |aₙ-A|<ε/2 for all n≥N₁ .Since 月→00

lim bₙ = B ,there exists a constant $N_{2}$ such that |bₙ - B| < ε/2 for all n≥N₂ Let $N$ be the larger of $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ n→∞

Therefore, for all n ≥ N

|(aₙ+bₙ)-(A+B)|≤|aₙ-A|+|bₙ-B|<ε/2+ε/2=ε

The algebraic ii aws allw us to evaluate imts for many sequece. For example, onsider the sequence {1/n²} A shown earlier, lim $1/n=0$ . Similarly, for any positive integer. $k$ we can conclude that 日

limₙ→∞1/nᵏ = 0

In the next example, we make use of this fact along with the limit laws to evaluate limits for other sequences.

### EXAMPLE 5.3

### Determining Convergence and Finding Limits

For each of the following sequences, determine whether or not the sequence converges. If it converges,find its limit

. {2ⁿ/n²} {5-3/n²} { (3n⁴ - 7n² + 5) / (6 - 4n⁴) } d. {(1+4/n)ⁿ}

### $②$ Solution

a.We know that 1/n→0 .Using this fact, we conclude that
, we conclude that limₙ→∞ 1/n² = limₙ→∞(1/n) . limₙ→∞(1/n) = 0.

Therefore,

lim_(n→∞)(5 - 3/n²) = lim_(n→∞)5 - 3lim_(n→∞)(1/n²) = 5 - 3⋅0 = 5.

The sequence converges and its limit is 5.

lim_(n→∞)(3n⁴-7n²+5)/(6-4n⁴) = lim_(n→∞)(3-7/n²+5/n⁴)/(6/n⁴-4) = (lim_(n→∞)(3-7/n²+5/n⁴))/(lim_(n→∞)(6/n⁴-4)) = (lim_(n→∞)3 - lim_(n→∞)7/n² + lim_(n→∞)5/n⁴)/(lim_(n→∞)6/n⁴ - lim_(n→∞)4) = (3-7*0+5*0)/(6*0-4) = -3/4

The sequence converges and its limit is -3/4

c.Consider the related function $f(x)=2^{x}/x^{2}$ defined on all real numbers $x>0$ .Since 2ˣ→∞ and x²→∞ a x→∞ , apply L'Hopital's rule and write

Take the derivatives of the numerator and denominator im2= im2n2 im 2(n Take he dervaives gin =∞0.

We conclude that the sequence diverges.

d.Consider the function f(x)=(1+4/x)ˣ defined on all real numbers $x>0$ . This function has the indeterminate form 1∞ as x→∞ . Let
y=lim(x→∞)(1+4/x)^x

Now taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation, we obtain

ln(y) = ln[lim(x→∞)(1 + 4/x)^x].

Since the function f(x) = ln x is continuous on its domain, we can interchange the limit and the natural logarithm Therefore,
ln(y) = lim_(x→∞) [ln((1+4/x)^x)]

Using properties of loaarithms. we write

lim_(x→∞)[ln((1+4/x)ˣ)]=lim_(x→∞)xln(1+4/x)

Since the right-hand side of this equation has the indeterminate form 00·0 ,rewrite it as a fraction to apply L'Hopital's rule. Write
limₓ→∞ xln(1+4/x) = limₓ→∞ ln(1+4/x)/(1/x)

Since the right-hand side is now in the indeterminate form O/0, we are able to apply LHopital's rule. We conclude that
lim(x→∞)ln(1+4/x)/(1/x)=lim(x→∞)4/(1+4/x)=4.

Therefore, In $(y)=4$ and $y=e^{4}.$ Therefore, since lim (1+4/x)^x=e⁴ we can conclude that the sequence

{(1+4/n)ⁿ} converges to $e^4$

√2  5.3 Consider the sequence {(5n²+1)/eⁿ}, Determine whether or not the sequence converges. If it converges, find its limit.

Recall that if $f$ is a continuous function at a value $L$ ,then f(x)→f(L) as x→L This idea applies to sequences as well Suppose a sequence aₙ→L ,and a function $f$ is continuous at $L.$ Then 
f(aₙ) → f(L) .This property often enables us to find limits for complicated sequences. For example, consider the sequence √(5-3/n²) From Example 5.3a. we know the sequence 5-3→5. Since √x is a continuous function at $x=5$

lim(n→∞)√(5-3/n²) = √(lim(n→∞)(5-3/n²)) = √5.

### Theorem 5.3

Continuous Functions Defined on Convergent Sequences Consider a sequence {aₙ} and suppose there exists a real number $L$ such that the sequence {aₙ} converges to $L$

Suppose $f$ is a continuous function at $L.$ Then there exists an integer $N$ such that $f$ is defined at all values $a_n$ for n ≥ N , and the sequence {f(aₙ)} converges to $f(L)$ (Figure 5.5)

### Proof

Let ϵ>0 Since $f$ is continuous at $L$ ,there exists δ > 0 such that |f(x)-f(L)|<ε if |x-L| < δ .Since the sequence {aₙ} converges to $L$ there exists $N$ such that |aₙ - L| < δ for all n≥N Therefore, for all 
n ≥ N, |aₙ - L| < δ which implies |f(aₙ)-f(L)|<ε We conclude that the sequence 
{f(aₙ)} converges to $f(L)$

### Solution

Since the sequence {3/n²} converges to O and cos x is continuous at $x=0$ I, we can conclude that the sequence {cos(3/n²)} converges and

limₙ→∞ cos(3/n²) = cos(0) = 1

Determine i the seqguence {√((2n+1)/(3n+5))} converges.Iit converes, fin its imit

Another theorem involving limits of sequences is an extension of the Squeeze Theorem for limits discussed in Introduction to Limits (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/2-introduction)

Theorem 5.4

Squeeze Theorem for Sequences Consider sequencese {aₙ}, {bₙ}, {bₙ} [bn} and {cₙ}. Suppose there exists an integer $N$ such that

aₙ≤bₙ≤cₙ for all n≥N

If there exists areal number $L$ such that

lim<sub>n→∞</sub>a<sub>n</sub> = L = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>c<sub>n</sub>

then {bₙ} converges and lim $b_{a}=L$ (Fiqure 5.6) →00

### Proof

Let ε>0 Since the sequence {aₙ} converges to $L$ ,there exists an integer $N_{1}$ such that |aₙ - L| < ε for all n≥N₁ Similarly, since. {cₙ} converges to $L$ , there exists an integer $N_{2}$ such that |cₙ-L|<ε for all n≥N₂ .By assumption, there exists an integer $N$ such that aₙ ≤ bₙ ≤ cₙ for all n≥N Let $M$ be the largest of $N_{1},N_{2}$ , and $N.$ We must show

that |b_n-L|<ε for all n≥M , For all n≥M

-ε<-|aₙ-L|≤aₙ-L≤bₙ-L≤cₙ-L≤|cₙ-L|<ε

Therefore, -ε < bη - L < ε and we conclude that |b_n-L|<ε for all n≥M ,and we conclude that the sequence {bₙ converges to $L$

Figure 5.6 Each term $b_n$ satisfies aₙ≤bₙ≤cₙ and the sequences {aₙ} and {cₙ} converge to the same limit, so the sequence {bₙ} must converge to the same limit as well.

### EXAMPLE 5.5

### Using the Squeeze Theorem

Use the Squeeze Theorem to find the limit of each of the following sequences.

# {cos n/n²} {(-1/2)ⁿ}

### $②$ Solution

a.Since -1 ≤ cos n ≤ 1 for all integers n, we have

-1/n² ≤ cos(n)/n² ≤ 1/n²

Since -1/n²→0 and 1/n²→0 ,we conclude that cos n/n² → 0 as well b.Since

-1/2ⁿ≤(-1/2)ⁿ≤1/2ⁿ

for all positive integersn -1/2ⁿ→0  and 1/2ⁿ → 0 ,we can conclude that (-1/2)'→0

 5.5 Find lim 2msin → 00

Using the idea from Example 5.5b. we conclude that rⁿ→0 for anyreal number $r$ such that $-1<r<0$ If $r<-1$ ,the sequence {rⁿ} diverges because the terms oscillate and become arbitrarily large in magnitude. If $r=-1$ , the sequence {rⁿ} = {(-1)ⁿ} diverges, as discussed earlier. Here is a summary of the properties for geometric sequences.


1. rⁿ→0 if |r|<1

## Bounded Sequences

We now turn our attention to one of themost important theorems involving sequences: the Monotone Convergence Theorem.Before stating the theorem,we need to introduce some terminoloqy and motivation.We beqin by defininc what it means for a seauence to be bounded

### Definition

A sequence {aₙ} is bounded above if there exists a real number $M$ such that

aₙ ≤ M

for all positive integers n.

A sequence {aₙ} is bounded below if there exists a real number $M$ such that

M ≤ aₙ

for all positive integers n.

A sequence {aₙ} is a bounded sequence if it is bounded above and bounded below

If a sequence is not bounded, it is an unbounded sequence

For example, the sequence {1/n} is bounded above because 1/n≤1 for all positive integers n. It is also bounded below because 1/n≥0 for all positive integers n.Therefore, {1/n} is a boundedsequence.On the other hand,consider the sequence {2^n} Because 2ⁿ≥2 for all n≥1 ,the sequence is bounded below.However, the sequence is not boundec above. Therefore, {2ⁿ} is an unbounded sequence.

We now discuss the relationship between boundedness and convergence. Suppose a sequence {aₙ} is unbounded. Then it is not bounded above, or not bounded below, or both. In either case, there are terms $a_n$ that are arbitrarily large in magnitude as n gets larger. As a result, the sequence {aₙ} cannot converge. Therefore, being bounded is a necessary. condition for a sequence to converge.

### Theorem 5.5

## Convergent Sequences Are Bounded If a sequence {aₙ} converges, then it is bounded

Note that a sequence being bounded is not a sufficient condition for a sequence to converge. For example, the sequence {(-1)^n} is bounded, but the sequence diverges because the sequence oscillates between 1 and -1 and never approaches a finite number. We now discuss a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for a bounded sequence to converge.

Consider a bounded sequence {aₙ} . Suppose the sequence {aₙ} is increasing. That is, a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ a₃… Since the sequence is increasing, the terms are not oscillating.Therefore, there are two possibilities.The sequence could diverge to infinity, or it could converge. However, since the sequence is bounded, it is bounded above and the sequence cannot diverge to infinity. We conclude that {aₙ} converges. For example, consider the sequence

{1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, ...}

Since this sequence is increasing and bounded above,it converqes. Next, consider the sequence

{2,0,3,0,4,0,1,-1/2,-1/3,-1/4,…}

Even though the sequence isnot increasing for all values of $n$ ,we see that -1/2<-1/3<-1/4<… Therefore, starting with the eighth term, $a_{8}=-1/2$ , the sequence is increasing. In this case, we say the sequence is eventuallyincreasing Since the sequence is bounded above, it converges. It is also true that if a sequence is decreasing (or eventually decreasing) and bounded below, it also converges.

### Definition

A sequence {aₙ} is increasing for all n≥n₀ if

aₙ≤aₙ₊₁ for all n≥n₀

A sequence {aₙ} is decreasing for all n ≥ n₀ if

aₙ≥aₙ₊₁ for all n≥n₀

A sequence {aₙ} is amonotone sequence for all n ≥ n₀ if it is increasing for all n≥n₀ or decreasing for all n≥n₀

We now have the necessary definitions to state the Monotone ConverqenceTheorem,which qives a sufficient condition for convergence of asequence.

### Theorem 5.6

## Monotone Convergence Theorem

If {aₙ} is a bounded sequence and there exists a positive integer $n_0$ such that {aₙ} is monotone for all n≥n₀, then {aₙ} converges.

The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text.Instead,we provide a qraph to show intuitively why this theorem makes sense (Eigure 5.7))

![](./images/fmwRMQiyvGuV7x9dx4SuAhuwgbiDZaKv5.png)

Figure 5.7 Since the sequence {aₙ} is increasing and bounded above, it must converge

In the following example, we show how the Monotone Convergence Theorem can be used to prove convergence of a sequence.

## EXAMPLE 5.6

### Using the Monotone Convergence Theorem For each of the following sequences, use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to show the sequence converges and find

its limit.

a. {4ⁿ/n!} b. {aₙ} defined recursively such that

a₁=2 and aₙ₊₁ = aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) for all n≥2.

## $①$ Solution

a.Writing out the first few terms, we see that

{4<sup>n</sup>/n!} = {4, 8, 32/3, 32/3, 128/15, …}

At first, the terms increase. However, after the third term, the terms decrease. In fact, the terms decrease for all n≥3 We can show this as follows.

aₙ₊₁ = 4ⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)! = 4/(n+1) * 4ⁿ/n! = 4/(n+1) * aₙ ≤ aₙ if n ≥ 3

Therefore, the sequence is decreasing for al n≥3 .Further, the sequence is bounded below by O because 4ⁿ/n! ≥ 0 for all positive integers $n$ . Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence converges To find the limit, we use the fact that the sequence converges and let 
L=lim aₙ . Now note this important →O

observation. Consider lim aₙ₊₁ Since

是一

{aₙ₊₁}={a₂,a₃,a₄,...},

the only difference between the sequences {aₙ₊₁} and {aₙ} is that {aₙ₊₁} omits the first term. Since a finite number of terms does not affect the convergence of a sequence,
lim_(n→∞)a_(n+1)=lim_(n→∞)aₙ=L.

Combining this fact with the equation

aₙ₊₁ = 4/(n+1)aₙ

and taking the limit of both sides of the equation

limₙ→∞ aₙ₊₁ = limₙ→∞ (4/(n+1))aₙ

we can conclude that

L=0·L=0

b.Writing out the first several terms,

{2, 5/4, 41/40, 3281/3280, …}

we can conjecture that the sequence is decreasing and bounded below by 1. To show that the sequence is bounded below by 1, we can show that
aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) ≥ 1

To show this, first rewrite

aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) = (aₙ²+1)/(2aₙ).

Since aₗ > 0 and $a_2$ is defined as a sum of positive terms, $a_2>0$ Similarly, all terms $a_n>0.$ Therefore
(aₙ² + 1)/(2aₙ) ≥ 1

if and only if

a_n²+1≥2a_n

Rewriting the inequality aₙ²+1≥2aₙ as aₙ²-2aₙ+1≥0 , and using the fact that aₙ² - 2aₙ + 1 = (aₙ-1)² ≥ 0 

because the square of any real number is nonnegative, we can conclude that

aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) ≥ 1

To show that the sequence is decreasing, we must show that aₙ₊₁≤aₙ for all n≥1 Since 1 ≤ aₙ² ,it follows that aₙ² + 1 ≤ 2aₙ²

Dividing both sides by $2a_n$ , we obtain

aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) ≤ aₙ.

Using the definition of $a_{n+1}$ , we conclude that

aₙ₊₁ = aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ) ≤ aₙ.

Since {aₙ} is bounded below and decreasing, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. To find the limit, let 
L=lim aₙ .Then using therecurrencerelation and the fact that lim aₙ = lim aₙ₊₁ ,we have → n→∞

lim (n→∞) aₙ₊₁ = lim (n→∞) (aₙ/2 + 1/(2aₙ))

and therefore

L=L/2+1/(2L)

Multiplying both sides of this equation by $2L$ , we arrive at the equation $2L^{2}=L^{2}+1$

Solving this equation for $L$ we conclude that $L^{2}=1$ , which implies L=±1 Since all the terms are positive, the limit $L=1$

5.6 Consider the sequence {aₙ} defined recursively such that $a_1=1,a_n=a_{n-1}/2.$ Use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to show that this sequence converges and find its limit.

# 5.2 Infinite Series

## Learning Objectives

5.2.1 Explain the meaning of the sum of an infinite series 5.2.2Calculate the sum of a geometricseries. 5.2.3 Evaluate a telescoping series.

We have seen that a sequence is an ordered set of terms. If you add these terms together, you get a series. In this section we define an infinite series and show how series are related to sequences. We also define what it means for a series to converge or diverge. We introduce one of the most important types of series: the geometric series. We will use geometric series in the next chapter to write certain functions as polynomials with an infinite number of terms. This process is important because it allows us to evaluate, differentiate, and integrate complicated functions by using polynomials that are easier to handle. We also discuss the harmonic series, arguably the most interesting divergent series because it just fails to converge

## Sums andSeries

An infinite series is a sum of infinitely many terms and is written in the form

∑ᵢ₌₁^∞aᵢ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ...

But what does this mean? We cannot add an infinite number of terms in the same way we can add a finite number of terms. Instead, the value of an infinite series is defined in terms of the limit of partial sums. A partial sum of an infinite series is a finite sum of the form

∑(k, n=1) aₙ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₖ

To see how we use partial sums to evaluate infinite series, consider the following example. Suppose oil is seeping into a lake such that 1000 gallons enters the lake the first week. During the second week, an additional 500 gallons of oil enters the lake. The third week, 250 more gallons enters the lake. Assume this pattern continues such that each week half as much oil enters the lake as did the previous week.If this continues forever, what can we say about the amount of

oil in the lake?willthe amount of oil continue to get arbitrarily large,or is it possible that it approaches some finite amount? To answer this question, we look at the amount of oil in the lake after $k$ weeks. Letting $S_k$ denote the amount of oil in the lake (measured in thousands of qallons) after $k$ weeks,we see tha

S₁ = 1, S₂ = 1 + 0.5 = 1 + ½, S₃ = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 1 + ½ + ¼, S₄ = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛, S₅ = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + 1/16

Looking at this pattern, we see that the amount of oil in the lake (in thousands of gallons) after $k$ weeks is

Sₖ=1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+⋯+1/2ᵏ⁻¹=Σₙ₌₁ᵏ(1/2)ⁿ⁻¹.

We are interested in what happens as k→∞ . Symbolically, the amount of oil in the lake as k→∞ is given by the infinite series

Σₙ₌₁^∞ (1/2)ⁿ⁻¹ = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …

At the same time, as k→∞ , the amount of oil in the lake can be calculated by evaluating lim Sₖ $S_k$ $S_k$ . Therefore, th k→00

behavior of the infinite series can be determined by looking at the behavior of the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} If the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} converges, we say that the infinite series converges, and its sum is given by lim $S_{k}$ .If k→00

the sequence {Sₖ} diverges, we say the infinite series diverges. We now turn our attention to determining the limit of this sequence {Sₖ}

First, simplifying some of these partial sums, we see that

S₁ = 1, S₂ = 3/2, S₃ = 7/4, S₄ = 15/8, S₅ = 31/16.

Plotting some of these values in Figure 5.10, it appears that the sequence {Sₖ} could be approaching 2

![](./images/fhBRCh1D4gUC0YMDWSoxqqWk0ig2tMyy5.png)

Figure 5.10 The graph shows the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} It appears that the sequence is approaching the value 2.

Let's look for more convincing evidence. In the following table, we list the values of $S_{k}$ for several values of $k$


2|0.2|y=y_{1}+hf\left(x_{1},y_{1}\right)=1.514

These data supply more evidence suggesting that the sequence {Sₖ} converges to 2. Later we will provide an analytic argument that can be used to prove that lim $S_{k}=2$ . For now, we rely on the numerical and graphical data to convince k→00

ourselves that the sequence of partial sums does actually converge to 2. Since this sequence of partial sums converges to 2, we say the infinite series converges to 2 and write

∑_(n=1)^∞ (1/2)^(n-1) = 2

Returning to the guestion about the oilin the lake.since this infiniteseries converges to 2.we conclude that the amounf of oil in the lake will get arbitrarily close to 2000 gallons as the amount of time gets sufficiently large.

This series is an example of a aeometric series. We discuss geometric series in more detail later in this section. First, we summarize what it means for an infinite series to converge.

## Definition

An infinite series is an expression of the form

∑_(n=1)^∞ aₙ=a₁+a₂+a₃+…

For each positive integer k,the sum

 Sₖ = Σₙ₁ᵏ aₙ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₖ

is called the kth partial sum of the infinite series.The partial sums form a sequence {Sₖ} If the sequence of partial sums converges to a real number $S$ , the infinite series converges. If we can describe the convergence of a series to $S$ we call $S$ the sum of the series, and we write

![](./images/fIl1o9z6OCmBvzKxKSq02kczUHkcCCZ9N.png)

If the sequence of partial sums diverges, we have the divergence of a series.

Note that the index for a series need not begin with $n=1$ but can begin with any value.For example, the series

∑ₙ₁^∞(1/2)ⁿ⁻¹

can also be written as

∑ₙ₌₀∞(1/2)ⁿ or ∑ₙ₌₅∞(1/2)ⁿ⁻⁵

Often it is convenient for the index to begin at 1, so if for some reason it begins at a different value, we can reindex by

making a change of variables. For example, consider the series

∑(n=2 to ∞) 1/n²

By introducing the variable $m=n-1$ ,So that $n=m+1$ ,we can rewrite the series as

∑_{m=1}^∞ 1/(m+1)²

### EXAMPLE 5.7

### Evaluating Limits of Sequences of Partial Sums

For each of the following series, use the sequence of partial sums to determine whether the series converges or diverges.

### $②$ Solution

a.The sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} satisfies

S₁ = 1/2, S₂ = 1/2 + 2/3, S₃ = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4, S₄ = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + 4/5.

Notice that each term added is greater than 1/2. As a result,we see that
910 cater tilail 1/2, As a result, we see that S₁ = 1/2, S₂ = 1/2 + 2/3 > 1/2 + 1/2 = 2(1/2), S₃ = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 > 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3(1/2), S₄ = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + 4/5 > 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4(1/2).

From this pattern we can see that Sₖ>k(1/2) for every integer $k$ . Therefore, {Sₖ} is unbounded and consequently, diverges. Therefore, te infinit series ∑_{n=1}^∞ n/(n+1) diverges b.The sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} satisfies

S₁ = -1, S₂ = -1 + 1 = 0, S₃ = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1, S₄ = -1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 0

From this pattern we can see the sequence of partial sums is
{Sₖ} = {-1, 0, -1, 0, …}



1/3+1/4>1/4+1/4

Therefore, we condlude that

S₄>1+1/2+(1/4+1/4)=1+1/2+1/2=1+2(1/2)

Using the same idea for $S_{8}$ , we see that

S₈=1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8>1+1/2+(1/4+1/4)+(1/8+1/8+1/8+1/8)=1+1/2+1/2+1/2=1+3(1/2).

From this pattern, we see that $S_{1}=1,S_{2}=1+1/2$ S₄ > 1 + 2(1/2) , and 
S₈>1+3(1/2) More generally, it can be shown that $S_{2j}>1+j(1/2)$ for all $j>1.$ Since 1+j(1/2)→∞ ,we conclude that the sequence {Sₖ} is unbounded and therefore diverges. In the previous section, we stated that convergent sequences are bounded. Consequently, since {Sₖ} is unbounded, it diverges. Thus, the harmonic series diverges

### Algebraic Properties of Convergent Series

Since the sum of a convergent infinite series is defined as a limit of a sequence, the algebraic properties for series listed below follow directly from the algebraic properties for sequences.

### EXAMPLE 5.8

### Using Algebraic Properties of Convergent Series Evaluate

Σₙ₌₁^∞[3/(n(n+1)) + (1/2)ⁿ⁻²]

### $②$ Solution

We showed earlier that

∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/(n(n+1))=1

and

∑_(n=1)^∞ (1/2)^(n-1) = 2

Since both of those series converge, we can apply the properties of Algebraic Properties of Convergent Series to evaluate

∑_{n=1}^∞[3/(n(n+1))+(1/2)^(n-2)].

Usinq the sum rule, write


∑ₙ₌₁^∞[3/(n(n+1)) + (1/2)^n⁻²] = ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ 3/(n(n+1)) + ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/2)^n⁻²

Then,using the constant multiple rule and the sums above,we can conclude that

∑_{n=1}^∞ 3/(n(n+1)) + ∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/2)^(n-2) = 3∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n(n+1)) + (1/2)^-1∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/2)^(n-1) = 3(1) + (1/2)^-1(2) = 3 + 2(2) = 7

### Geometric Series

Ageometricseriesis anyseries that we can write in theform

a + ar + ar² + ar³ + ... = ∑_(n=1)^∞ arⁿ⁻¹

Because theratio of each term in thisseries to the previous term is $r$, the number ris called theratio.Werefer to a as the initial term because it is the first term in the series.For example, the series

∑ₙ₌₁∞(1/2)ⁿ⁻¹=1+1/2+1/4+1/8+…

is a geometricserieswith initial term $a=1$ and ratio $r=1/2$

In qeneral, when does a qeometric series converge? Consider the qeometric series

∑ₙ₌₁∞arⁿ⁻¹

when $a>0.$ Its sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} is given by

Sₖ=∑_{n=1}^karⁿ⁻¹=a+ar+ar²+…+arᵏ⁻¹

Consider the case when $r=1.$ In that case

S<sub>k</sub>=a+a(1)+a(1)²+…+a(1)<sup>k-1</sup>=ak

Since $a>0$ , we know ak → ∞ as k→∞ .Therefore, the sequence of partial sums is unbounded and thus diverges

Consequently, the infinite series diverges for $r=1.$ For r ≠ 1 , to find the limit of {Sₖ}, multiply Equation 5.6 by $1-r$ Doing so, we see that

(1-r)Sₖ = a(1-r)(1+r+r²+r³+⋯+rᵏ⁻¹) = a[(1+r+r²+r³+⋯+rᵏ⁻¹)-(r+r²+r³+⋯+rᵏ)] = a(1-rᵏ)

Allthe other terms cancel out

Therefore,

Sₖ = a(1 - rᵏ)/(1 - r) for r ≠ 1.

From our discussion in the previous section,we know that the geometric sequence pk→ 0 rᵏ→0 rᵏ→0 if $|r|<1$ $|r|<1$ $|r|<1$ and that $r^k$ diverges if $|r|>1$ or r=±1 Therefore, for |r|<1, Sₖ→a/(1-r) and we have

∑ₙ₌₁^∞ arⁿ⁻¹ = a/(1-r) if |r|<1

If |r| ≥ 1, Sₖ diverges, and therefore

∑ₙ₌₁^∞ arⁿ⁻¹ diverges if |r| ≥ 1

### Definition

A qeometric series is a series of the form

∑ₙ₌₁∞arⁿ⁻¹=a+ar+ar²+ar³+…

If $|r|<1$ ,the series converges, and

∑_{n=1}^∞ arⁿ⁻¹ = a/(1-r) for |r|<1

If |r|≥1 ,the series diverges

Geometric series sometimes appear in slightly different forms. For example, sometimes the index beqins at a value other than $n=1$ or the exponent involves a linear expression for $n$ other than $n-1.$ As long as we can rewrite the series in the form given by Equation 5.5, it is a geometric series. For example, consider the series

∑_(n=0)^∞(⅔)^(n+2)

To see that this is a geometric series. we write out the first several terms

∑_{n=0}^{∞}(⅔)^(n+2) = (⅔)² + (⅔)³ + (⅔)⁴ + … = 4/9 + 4/9(⅔) + 4/9(⅔)² + …

We see that the initial term is $a=4/9$ and the ratio is $r=2/3$ .Therefore, the series can be written as

∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (4/9)(2/3)ⁿ⁻¹

Since $r=2/3<1$ , this series converges, and its sum is given by


Σ_(n=1)^∞ (4/9)(2/3)^(n-1) = (4/9)/(1-2/3) = 4/3

### EXAMPLE 5.9

Determining Convergence or Divergence of a Geometric Series

Determine whether each of the following geometric series converges or diverges, and if it converges, find its sum

a。∑ₙ₌₁∞(-3)ⁿ⁺¹/4ⁿ⁻¹ b. ∑ₙ₌₁∞e²ⁿ

### $②$ Solution

a.Writing out the first several terms in the series, we have
∑ₙ₌₁∞((-3)ⁿ⁺¹/4ⁿ⁻¹) = (-3)² + (-3)²(-3/4) + (-3)²(-3/4)² + … = 9 + 9(-3/4) + 9(-3/4)² + …

The initial term $a=9$ and theratio $r=-3/4$ Since $|r|=3/4<1$ , the series converges to

b.Writing this series as

e²∑_{n=1}^∞ (e²)ⁿ⁻¹

we can see that this is a geometric series where $r=e^{2}>1$ . Therefore, the series diverges.

We now turn our attention to a nice application of geometric series. We show how they can be used to write repeating decimals as fractions of integers.

### EXAMPLE 5.10

Use a geometric series to write 3.26 as a fraction of integers

Solution Since 3.262626… first we write

3.262626... = 3 + 26/100 + 26/10000 + 26/1000000 + ... = 3 + 26/10² + 26/10⁴ + 26/10⁶ + ...

Ignoring the term 3,the rest of this expresson is a geometric series with initial term $a=26/10^{2}$ and ratio $r=1/10^{2}$ Therefore, the sum of this series is

26/10²/ (1 - 1/10²) = 26/10²/ (99/10²) = 26/99

Thus,

3.262626…=3+26/99=323/99

## EXAMPLE 5.11

### Chapter Opener: Finding the Area of the Koch Snowflake

Define a sequence of figures {Fₙ} recursively as follows (Figure 5.11). Let $F_0$ be an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1. For n≥1 ,let $F_n$ be the curve created by removing the middle third of each side of $F_{n-1}$ and replacing it with an equilateral triangle pointing outward. The limiting figure as n→∞ is known as Koch's snowflake.

![](./images/fOzSvPKSx1BlL3R2Cf5O2XNUG1nxXElc9.png)
Figure 5.11 The first four figures, $F_0,F_1,F_2$ and $F_3.$ in the construction of the Koch snowflake

b.Find the area $A_n$ of figure $F_{n}$ . Evaluate lim $A_{n}$ to find the area of Koch's snowflake → 00

## $①$ Solution a. Let $N_n$ denote the number of sides of figure $F_n$ . Since $F_{0}$ is a triangle, $N_{0}=3$ . Let $l_n$ denote thelength of each

side of $F_{n}$ . Since $F_{0}$ is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $l_{0}=1$ , we now need to determine $N_{1}$ and $l_1$ Since $F_{1}$ is created by removing the middle third of each side and replacing that line segment with two line segments,for each side of $F_{0}$ , we get four sides in $F_{1}$ .Therefore, the number of sides for Fₗ is N₁=4⋅3

Since the length of each of these new line segments is 1/3 the length of the line segments in $F_{0}$ ,the length of the line segments for Fₗ is given by
l₁ = 1/3

Similarly, for $F_{2}$ , since the middle third of each side of Fₗ is removed and replaced with two line segments,the number of sides in $F_{2}$ is given by
N₂=4N₁=4(4⋅3)=4²⋅3

Since the length of each of these sides is 1/3 the length of the sides of $F_{1}$ ,the length of each side of figure $F_{2}$ is given by
l₂ = (1/3)⋅l₁ = (1/3)²

More generally, since $F_{n}$ is created by removing the middle third of each side of $F_{n-1}$ and replacing that line gment with two line segments of length (1/3)lₙ₋₁ in the shape of an equilateral triangle, we know that $N_{n}=4N_{n-1}$ and lₙ = lₙ₋₁/3 Therefore, the number of sides of figure $F_{n}$ is
Nₙ=4ⁿ⋅3

and the length of each side is

lₙ = (⅓)ⁿ.

Therefore, to calculate the perimeter of $F_{n}$, we multiply the number of sides $N_{n}$ and the length of each side $l_n.$ We conclude that the perimeter of $F_{n}$ is given by
Lₙ=Nₙ⋅lₙ=3⋅(4/3)ⁿ

Therefore, the length of the perimeter of Koch's snowflake is

L=limₙ→∞Lₙ=∞

b.Let $T_{n}$ denote the area of each new triangle created when forming $F_n$ . For $n=0$ $T_{0}$ is the area of the origina equilateral triangle. Therefore, T₀ = A₀ = √3/4 For n≥1 , since the lengths of the sides of the new triangle are 1/3 the length of the sides of $F_{n-1}$ ,we have
Tₙ = (1/3)²Tₙ₋₁ = (1/9)⋅Tₙ₋₁

Therefore, Tₙ=(1/9)ⁿ⋅√3/4 Since a new triangle is formed on each side of $F_{n-1}$
1 1, A=Aₙ₋₁+Nₙ₋₁·Tₙ=Aₙ₋₁+(3·4ⁿ⁻¹)(1/9)ⁿ√3/4=Aₙ₋₁+3/4(4/9)ⁿ√3/4

Writing out the first few terms $A_{0},A_{1},A_{2}$, we see that

A₀ = √3/4
A₁ = A₀ + (3/4)(4/9)(√3/4) = (√3/4)[1 + (3/4)(4/9)]
A₂ = A₁ + (3/4)(4/9)²(√3/4) = (√3/4)[1 + (3/4)(4/9) + (3/4)(4/9)²]

More generally

Aₙ=√3/4[1+3/4(4/9+(4/9)²+⋯+(4/9)ⁿ)]

Factoring 4/9 out of each term inside the inner parentheses. we rewrite our expression as
Aₙ = (√3/4)[1 + (1/3)(1 + 4/9 + (4/9)² + ... + (4/9)^(n-1)) ]

The expression 1+(4/9)+(4/9)²+…+(4/9)^(n-1) is a geometricsum.As shown earlie, this sum satisies
1+4/9+(4/9)²+…+(4/9)ⁿ⁻¹=[1-(4/9)ⁿ]/[1-(4/9)]

Substituting this expression into the expression above and simplifving.we conclude tha
Aₙ = (√3)/4[1 + 1/3(1-(4/9)ⁿ)/(1-(4/9))] = (√3)/4[8/5 - (3/5)(4/9)ⁿ].

Therefore, the area of Koch's snowflake is

A=limₙ→∞Aₙ=(2√3)/5

### ® Analysis

The Koch snowflake is interesting because it has finite area, yet infinite perimeter. Although at first this may seem impossible, recall that you have seen similar examples earlier in the text. For example, consider the region bounded by the curve $y=1/x^{2}$ and the $x$ -axis on the interval [1, ∞) . Since the improper integral

∫_1^∞ 1/x² dx

converges, the area of this region is finite, even though the perimeter is infinite.

## Telescoping Series

Considerth ses 
Σ_(n=1)^∞ 1/(n(n+1)) W dsused h eie n epe wtn a he ete ee e out the first several partial sums $S_{1},S_{2},...,S_{6}$ and noticing that they are all of the form Sₖ=k/(k+1) Here we use different technique to show that this series converges.By using partial fractions, we can write

1/(n(n+1))=1/n - 1/(n+1).

Therefore, the series can be written as


∑_{n=1}^∞[1/n - 1/(n+1)]=(1-1/2)+(1/2-1/3)+(1/3-1/4)+…

Writing out the first several terms in the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ}, we see that

S₁ = 1-1/2, S₂ = (1-1/2)+(1/2-1/3) = 1-1/3, S₃ = (1-1/2)+(1/2-1/3)+(1/3-1/4) = 1-1/4.

In general,

Sₖ=(1-1/2)+(1/2-1/3)+(1/3-1/4)+...+(1/k-1/(k+1))=1-1/(k+1).

Wenotice that the middle terms canceleach other out.leavina only thefirst andlast terms.In a sense.the serie collapses like aspyglasswith tubes that disappear into each other to shorten the telescope.For thisreason,we call series that has this property a telescoping series. For this series, since $S_{k}=1-1/(k+1)$ and 1/(k + 1) → 0 as k→∞ the sequence of partial sums converges to 1, and therefore the series converges to 1

## Definition

A telescoping series is a series in which most of the terms cancel in each of the partial sums, leaving only some of the first terms and some of the last terms

For example,any series of the form

∑_{n=1}^{∞}[bₙ-bₙ₊₁]=(b₁-b₂)+(b₂-b₃)+(b₃-b₄)+…

is a telescoping series. We can see this by writing out some of the partial sums. In particular, we see that

S₁=b₁-b₂  S₂=(b₁-b₂)+(b₂-b₃)=b₁-b₃  S₃=(b₁-b₂)+(b₂-b₃)+(b₃-b₄)=b₁-b₄

In general, the kth partial sum of this series is

$$S_{k}=b_{1}-b_{k+1}.$$

Since the kth partial sum can be simplified to the difference of these two terms, the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} will converge if and only if the sequence {bₖ₊₁} converges. Moreover, if the sequence. $b_{k+1}$ converges to some finite number B,then the sequence of partial sums converges to $b_{1}-B$ and therefore

∑ₙ₌₁^∞(bₙ-bₙ₊₁)=b₁-B

In the next example, we show how to use these ideas to analyze a telescoping series of this form

## EXAMPLE 5.12

## Evaluating a Telescoping Series

Determine whether the telescoping series

∑ₙ₌₁^∞[cos(1/n)-cos(1/(n+1))]

converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum.

## $②$ Solution

By writing out terms in the sequence of partial sums, we can see that

S₁ = cos(1) - cos(1/2)
S₂ = (cos(1) - cos(1/2)) + (cos(1/2) - cos(1/3)) = cos(1) - cos(1/3)
S₃ = (cos(1) - cos(1/2)) + (cos(1/2) - cos(1/3)) + (cos(1/3) - cos(1/4)) = cos(1) - cos(1/4)

In general,

Sₖ=cos(1)-cos(1/(k+1))

Since 1/(k + 1) → 0 as k→∞ and cos $x$ is a continuous function, cos(1/(k+1)) → cos(0) = 1 Therefore, we conclude that Sₖ → cos(1) - 1 The telescoping series converges and the sum is given by

∑_(n=1)^∞[cos(1/n)-cos(1/(n+1))]=cos(1)-1.

# 5.3 The Divergence and Integral Tests.

### Learning Objectives

5.3.1 Use the divergence test to determine whether a series converges or diverges. 5.3.2 Use the integral test to determine the convergence of a series. 5.3.3 Estimate the value of a series by finding bounds on its remainder term.

In the previous section, we determined the convergence or divergence of several series by explicitly calculating the limit of the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} In practice, explicitly calculating this limit can be difficult or impossible. Luckily several tests exist that allow us to determine convergence or divergence for many types of series. In this section, we discuss two of these tests: the divergence test and the integral test. We will examine several other tests in the rest of this chapter and then summarize how and when to use them

## Divergence Test

A series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ being convergen i guialen t th ovenene o the euence f atia sumn $(S_k$ )as k→∞

To verify this, notice that from the algebraic properties,

limₖ→∞ aₖ = limₖ→∞(Sₖ - Sₖ₋₁) = limₖ→∞ Sₖ - limₖ→∞ Sₖ₋₁ = S - S = 0.

Therefore ifrt ∑_(n=1)a_n converes thenth ter m aₙ→0 as n→∞ . An impotan osequence f tis actisthe folowinn statement:

 If aₙ→0 as n→∞, Σ_(n=1)^∞ aₙ diverges. 

This test is known as the divergence test because it provides a way of proving that a series diverges.

### Theorem 5.8

### Divergence Test

If lim aₙ=c≠0 or lim aₙ doesnt exsthen theseries a dvrges H→00 →00

It is important to note that the converse of this theorem is not true. That is, if lim aₙ = 0 , we cannot make any

In this section and the remaining sections of this chapter, we show many more examples of such series. Consequently although we can use the divergence test to show that a series diverges, we cannot use it to prove that a series converges. Specifically, if aₙ→0 ,the divergence test is inconclusive.

## EXAMPLE 5.13

### Using the divergence test

For each of the following series, apply the divergence test. If the divergence test proves that the series diverges, state so Otherwise, indicate that the divergence test is inconclusive.

### $②$ Solution

a.Since 
n/(3n-1)→1/3≠0 , by the divergence test, we can conclude that

diverges. b.Since 1/n³ → 0 , the divergence test is inconclusive.

C.Since e^(1/n²) → 1 ≠ 0 , by the divergence test, the series

∑_{n=1}^∞ e^(1/n²)

diverges.

### Inteqral Test

In the previous section, we proved that the harmonic series diverges by looking at the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} and showing that. $S_{2k}>1+k/2$ for all positive integers $k$ . In this section we use a different technique to prove the divergence of the harmonic series. This technique is important because it is used to prove the divergence or convergence of many other series. This test, called the integral test, compares an infinite sum to an improper integral It is important to note that this test can only be applied when we are considering a series whose terms are all positive.

To illustrate how the integral test works, use the harmonic series as an example. In Figure 5.12, we depict the harmonic series by sketching a sequence of rectangles with areas 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,... along with the function $f(x)=1/x.$ Fromthe graph, we see that

∑_(n=1)ᵏ1/n=1+1/2+1/3+⋯+1/k>∫₁ᵏ⁺¹1/xdx

Therefore, for each $k$ , the kth partial sum $S_{k}$ satisfiesd

Sₖ=∑_(n=1)^k 1/n > ∫₁^(k+1) 1/x dx = ln(k+1)

Since lim ln(k+1) = ∞ ,we see that the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} is unbounded. Therefore,. {Sₖ} diverges, and k→00

Figure 5.12 The sum of the areas of the rectangles is greater than the area between the curve $f(x)=1/x$ and the $x$ -axis for x≥1 Since the area bounded by the curve is infinite (as calculated by an improper integral), the sum of the areas of the rectangles is also infinite

No consier teseres ∑_(n=1)1/n² Wesho hoa nitegralcan euse to rovetha thisere converges n igure 5.13,we sketch a sequence of rectangles with areas 1, 1/2², 1/3², … along with the function $f(x)=1/x^{2}$ .From the graph we see that

∑_(n=1)^k 1/n² = 1 + 1/2² + 1/3² + ... + 1/k² < 1 + ∫₁^k 1/x² dx.

Therefore, for each $k$ the kth partial sum $S_{k}$ satisfies

Sₖ=∑ₙ₌₁ᵏ(1/n²) < 1+∫₁ᵏ(1/x²)dx = 2-1/k < 2

We conclude that the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} is bounded. We also see that |Sₖ| is an increasing sequence

Sₖ = Sₖ₋₁ + 1/k² for k ≥ 2

Since {Sₖ} is increasing and bounded, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. Therefore, the series Sione

![](./images/frgBGuSYO8B9wpgoVGrOxFF9u16f0HCsk.png)

Figure 5.13 The sum of the areas of the rectangles is less than the sum of the area of the first rectangle and the area between the curve $f(x)=1/x^2$ and the $x$ axis for x≥1 Since the area bounded by the curve is finite, the sum of the areas of the rectangles is also finite

We can extend thisidea toprove conergence ordivergence formany iferet series supose ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ is a series with positive terms $a_{n}$ such that there exists a continuous, positive, decreasing function $f$ where f(n) = aₙ for al positive integers. Then, as in Figure 5.14(a), for any integer $k$ , the kth partial sum $S_k$ satisfies

Sₖ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₖ < a₁ + ∫₁ᵏ f(x)dx < a₁ + ∫₁∞ f(x)dx

Threfore f ∫₁∞ f(x) $dx$ converges, the the eqce prtia s {Sₖ} is bounded Since {Sₖ} is an increasing sequence, if it is also a bounded sequence, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. We conclude that if ∫₁^∞ f(x)dx convergs, hen theseres ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ asea integer $k$ , the kth partial sum $S_k$ satisfies
Sₖ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₖ > ∫₁ᵏ⁺¹ f(x)dx

Figure 5.14 (a) If we can inscribe rectangles inside a region bounded by a curve $y=f(x)$ and the $x$ axis,and the area bounded by those curves for x≥1 is finite, then the sum of the areas of the rectangles is also finite. (b) If a set of rectangles circumscribes the region bounded by y=f(x) andthe $x$ axis for x≥1 and the region has infinite area, then the sum of the areas of the rectangles is also infinite

### Theorem 5.9

### Integral Test Supos S nis aseresithpotveterms $a_n$ Suppose her eis uncti $f$ and a psi integer $N$ such hr

the following three conditions are satisfied:.

i. $f$ is continuous ii. $f$ is decreasing, and ill。$f(n)=a_n$ for all integers n ≥ N Then

∑_(n=1)^∞ aₙ and ∫_N^∞ f(x)dx

both converge or both diverge (see Fiqure 5.14)

Athough onverene o ∫_N^∞ f(x) $dx$ imples onvergeceotheate eie ∑_(n=1)a_n .tde etatesale of the integral and the series are the same. They may be different, and often are. For example

∑ₙ₌₁^∞(1/e)ⁿ=1/e+(1/e)²+(1/e)³+⋯

is a geometricseries with initial term $a=1/e$ and ratio $r=1/e$ , which converges to

(1/e)/(1 - 1/e) = (1/e)/((e-1)/e) = 1/(e-1)

 However the eated integral ∫₁^∞(1/e)^xdx satsfes

∫₁^∞(1/e)^xdx = ∫₁^∞e⁻ˣdx = lim(b→∞)∫₁^be⁻ˣdx = lim(b→∞)-e⁻ˣ|₁^b = lim(b→∞)[-e⁻ᵇ + e⁻¹] = 1/e

### EXAMPLE 5.14

### Usinq the Inteqral Test

For each of the following series, use the integral test to determine whether the series converges or diverges. Assume that all conditions for the integral test are met.

a Σ1/n³ b. ∑_(n=1)^∞1/√(2n-1)

### $②$ Solution

a. Compare

∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n³ and ∫₁^∞ 1/x³ dx.

We have

∫_{1}^{∞} 1/x³ dx = lim_{b→∞} ∫_{1}^{b} 1/x³ dx = lim_{b→∞} [-1/(2x²) |_{1}^{b}] = lim_{b→∞} [-1/(2b²) + 1/2] = 1/2

Thus the in gra ∫₁^∞ 1/x³ dx convere, an thereorese de th e e

b. Compare

∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/√(2n-1) and ∫₁^∞1/√(2x-1)dx

Since

∫₁^∞ 1/√(2x-1) dx = lim(b→∞)∫₁ᵇ 1/√(2x-1) dx = lim(b→∞) √(2x-1)|₁ᵇ = lim(b→∞)[√(2b-1)-1] = ∞

th integral 
∫₁<sup>∞</sup>1/√(2x-1) $dx$ diverges an therefore

∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/√(2n-1)

 diverges.

### The p-Series

Th harmoni eres ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ I/n an theseres ∑ₙ₌₁∞1/n² ae oth erampleso e o ere aled $p$ seres

### Definition

For any real number p,the series

∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^p

is called a p-series.

We know the ρ series converges if. $p=2$ and diverges if $p=1.$ What about other values of. $p?$ In general, it is difficult,if not impossible, to compute the exact value of most $P$ -series. However, we can use the tests presented thus far to prove whether a $p$ series converges or diverges..

$p<0$ ,then 1/nᵖ→∞ , and if $p=0$ ,then 1/nᵖ → 1 Therefore, by the divergence test

∑_(n=1)^∞1/n^p diverges if p≤0.

If $p>0$ ,then $f(x)=1/x^{p}$ is a positive, continuous, decreasing function. Therefore, for $p>0$ , we use the integral test comparing

∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/nᵖ and ∫₁^∞1/xᵖdx

We have already considered the case when $p=1.$ Here we consider the case when p>0, p≠1. For this case,
∫₁^∞ 1/xᵖ dx = lim(b→∞)∫₁ᵇ 1/xᵖ dx = lim(b→∞) [1/(1-p)x¹⁻ᵖ]|₁ᵇ = lim(b→∞) 1/(1-p)[b¹⁻ᵖ - 1]

Because

b^(1-p)→0 if p>1 and b^(1-p)→∞ if p<1

we conclude that

∫₁^∞ 1/x^p dx = {1/(p-1) if p>1; ∞ if p≤1}

Therefore, ∑_{n=1}^∞1/n^p converges i $p>1$ and divergesift $0<p<1$ In summary,

∑ₙ₌₁^∞ 1/(nᵖ){converges if p>1, diverges if p≤1}

### EXAMPLE 5.15

### Testing for Convergence of p-series

For each of the following series, determine whether it converges or diverges.

a. ∑_{n=1}^∞1/n⁴ b. ∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/n^(2/3)

Solution

a. This is a ρ series with $p=4>1$ , so the series converges b.Since $p=2/3<1$ , the series diverges..

### Theorem 5.10

### Remainder Estimate from the Inteqral Test

Suppose ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ i a ce ere th ive e te x futio $f$ Satisying the following three conditions

i. $f$ is continuous, ii。$f$ is decreasing, and ili. $f(n)=a_n$ for all integers n≥1

∫_(N+1)^∞f(x)dx < Rₙ < ∫_N^∞f(x)dx

This is known as the remainder estimate

We illustrate Remainder Estimate from the Integral Test in Fiqure 5.15. In particular, by representing the remainde Rₙ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ₊₂ + aₙ₊₃ + … as the sum of areas of rectangles,we see that the area of those rectangles is

boundedabove by  ∫_(N)^∞ f(x)dx  and bounded below by ∫ₙ₊₁∞ f(x)dx In ther words

Rₙ=aₙ₊₁+aₙ₊₂+aₙ₊₃+⋯>∫ₙ₊₁^∞f(x)dx

and

Rₙ=aₙ₊₁+aₙ₊₂+aₙ₊₃+…<∫ₙ∞f(x)dx

We conclude that

∫_(N+1)∞ f(x)dx < Rₙ < ∫_N∞ f(x)dx

Since

∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n=S_N+R_N,

where $S_{N}$ is the Nth partial sum, we conclude that

### Estimating the Value of a Series

Consider the eries ∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/n³ a. Calulate S₁₀=∑ⁿ₌₁¹⁰1/n³ and estimate the eror

b. Determine the least value of. $N$ necessary such that $S_{N}$ will estimate . 1/n3 to within 0.001

a.Using a calculating utility, we have

S₁₀ = 1 + 1/2³ + 1/3³ + 1/4³ + ... + 1/10³ ≈ 1.19753

By the remainder estimate, we know

R<sub>N</sub> < ∫<sub>N</sub><sup>∞</sup>1/x³dx.

We have

∫₁₀^∞ 1/x³ dx = lim(b→∞) ∫₁₀^b 1/x³ dx = lim(b→∞) [-1/(2x²)]₁₀^b = lim(b→∞) [-1/(2b²) + 1/(200)] = 1/200.

Therefore, the error is $R_{10}<1/2(10)^{2}=0.005$ b.Find $N$ such that $R_{N}<0.001$ . In part a. we showed that $R_{N}<1/(2N^{2})$ . Therefore, the remainder $R_{N}<0.001$ as

long as $1/(2N^{2})<0.001$ . That is, we need $2N^{2}>1000$ .Solving this inequality for $N$ ,we see that we need $N>22.36$ To ensure that the remainder is within the desired amount, we need to round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the minimum necessary value is $N=23$

For ∑_{n=1}^∞1/n⁴, Calclate s andestimate the eror R

187. [T] The simplest way to shuffle cards is to take the top card and insert it at a random place in the deck called top random insertion, and then repeat. We will consider a deck to be randomly shuffled once enough top random insertions have been made that the card originally at the bottom has reached the top and then been randomly inserted.If the deck has r cards, then the probability that the insertion will be below the card initially at the bottom (call this card B) is 1/n. Thus the expected number of top random insertions before $B$ is no longer at the bottom is n.Once one card is below $B$ ,there are two places below $B$ and the probability that a randomly inserted card will fall below $B$ is $2/n$ The expected number of top random insertions before this happens is $n/2$ . The two cards below $B$ are now in random order. Continuing this way, find a formula for the expected number of top random insertions needed to consider the deck to be randomly shuffled 190.

# 5.4 Comparison Tests

Learning Objectives

5.4.1 Use the comparison test to test a series for convergence 5.4.2 Use the limit comparison test to determine convergence of a series.

We have seen that the integral test allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of a series by comparing it to a related improper integral. In this section, we show how to use comparison tests to determine the convergence or divergence of a series by comparing it to a series whose convergence or divergence is known. Typically these tests are used to determine convergence of series that are similar to geometric series or $p$ -series

## Comparison Test

In the preceding two sections, we discussed two large classes of series: geometric series and $p$ series.We know exactl when these series converge and when they diverge. Here we show how to use the convergence or divergence of these series to prove convergence or divergence for other series, using a method called the comparison test

For example, consider the series

∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n²+1).

This series looks similar to the convergent series

∑ₙ₌₁∞1/n²

Since the terms in each of the series are positive, the sequence of partial sums for each series is monotone increasing Furthermore, since

0<1/(n²+1)<1/n²

for all positive integers $n$ ,the kth partial sum $S_k$ ofsatisfie

Sₖ=∑_{n=1}ᵏ 1/(n²+1) < ∑_{n=1}ᵏ 1/n² < ∑_{n=1}∞ 1/n²

(See Figure 5.16(a) and Table 5.1.) Since the series on the right converges, the sequence {Sₖ} is bounded above. We conclude that {Sₖ} is a monotone increasing sequence that is bounded above.Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, {Sₖ} converges, and thus

∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/(n²+1)

converges.

Similarly, consider the series

∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n-1/2)

This series looks similar to the divergent series

∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/n

The sequence of partial sums for each series is monotone increasing and

1/(n-1/2) > 1/n > 0

for every positive integer $n$ Therefore, the kth partial sum $S_{k}$ of satisfie

Sₖ=∑_(n=1)^k 1/(n-½)>∑_(n=1)^k 1/n

(Se Figure 5.16(b) and Table 5.2. Since the series ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ 1/n divergesto ininty,the sequence of partial sums Z"= 1/n is unbounded. Consequently. {Sₖ} is an unbounded sequence, and therefore diverges.We conclude that


∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n-1/2)

diverges.

### Theorem 5.11

### Comparison Test

i. Suppose there exists an integer $N$ such that 0≤aₙ≤bₙ for all n≥N If ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges

lil. Suppose there exists an integer $N$ such that aₙ ≥ bₙ ≥ 0 for all n≥N If ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ diverges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ diverges.

### Proof

We prove part i. The proof of part i. is the contrapositive of part i. Let Sₖ be the sequence of partial sums associated with ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ , and let L = Σₙ₌₁^∞ bₙ . Since the terms aₙ≥0

Sₖ=a₁+a₂+…+aₖ≤a₁+a₂+…+aₖ+aₖ₊₁=Sₖ₊₁

Therefore, the sequence of partial sums is increasing.Further, since aₙ≤bₙ for all n ≥ N ,then

∑_{n=N}^kaₙ≤∑_{n=N}^kbₙ≤∑_{n=1}^∞bₙ=L.

Therefore, for all k≥1

Sₖ = (a₁+a₂+…+aₙ₋₁) + Σₙ₌ₙᵏ aₙ ≤ (a₁+a₂+…+aₙ₋₁) + L.

Since a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₙ₋₁ is a finite number, we conclude that the sequence {Sₖ} is bounded above. Therefore, {Sₖ} is an increasing sequence that is bounded above.By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we conclude that $[S_{k}]$

### Limit Comparison Test

The comparison test works nicely if we can find a comparable series satisfying the hypothesis of the test. However

sometimes finding an appropriate series can be difficult. Consider the series

∑ₙ₂^∞1/(n²-1)

It is natural to compare this series with the convergent series

∑(n=2 to ∞) 1/n²

However, this series does not satisfy the hypothesis necessary to use the comparison test because

1/(n²-1)>1/n²

eadw forall integers n ≥ 2 .Although we could look for a different series with which to show how we can use the limit comparison test to compare

Σₙ₌₂∞1/(n²-1) and Σₙ₌₂∞1/n².

Let us examine the idea behind the limit comparison test Consider two series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ . with positive terms $a_n$ and $b_{n}$ and evaluate

limₙ→∞(aₙ/bₙ)

If

limₙ→∞(aₙ/bₙ) = L ≠ 0

then, for n sufficiently large, aₙ ≈ Lbₙ .Therefore,either both series converge or both series diverge.For the serie ∑ₙ₌₂^∞1/(n²-1) and ∑(∞, n=2) 1/n² ,we see that

lim_(n→∞) (1/(n²-1))/(1/n²) = lim_(n→∞) n²/(n²-1) = 1

Since ∑(∞, n=2) 1/n² converges, we conclude that

∑_(n=2)^∞ 1/(n²-1)

### converges.

The limit comparison test can be used in two other cases. Suppose

limₙ→∞ aₙ/bₙ = 0

In this case, {aₙ/bₙ} is a bounded sequence. As a result, there exists a constant $M$ such that 
aₙ≤Mbₙ . Therefore, if ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges. On the other hand, suppose

lim_(n→∞)a_n/b_n=∞

In this case, {aₙ/bₙ} is an unbounded sequence.Therefore, for every constant $M$ there exists an integer $N$ such that

aₙ≥Mbₙ for all n ≥ N Therefore, if ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ diverges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ diverges as well.

### Theorem 5.12

### Limit Comparison Test

Let $a_n$ bₙ≥0 for all n≥1

i. If lim a/bhn = L ≠ 0.,then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ both converge or both diverge If (n→∞) aₙ/bₙ = L≠0

il. If lim a/bn = 0 and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges. limₙ→∞aₙ/bₙ=0

il. If lim a/bhn = o and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ diverges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ diverges limₙ→∞ aₙ/bₙ = ∞

Note that if aₙ/bₙ→0 and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ diverges, the limit comparison test gives no information. Similarly, if aₙ/bₙ→∞ and ∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ converge, te tst as rosides n inormaton or rmple coside the e erieee Σₙ₌₁¹/√n anc

### EXAMPLE 5.18

### Using the Limit Comparison Test

For each of the following series,use thelimit comparison test to determine whether the series converges or diverges.If the test does not apply, say so.

a. ∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/(√n+1) 

b. ∑_(n=1)^∞(2^n+1)/3^n C. ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ ln(n)/n²

### $②$ Solution

a. Compare this seriesto ∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/√n . Calculate

 lim_(n→∞)(1/√(n+1))/(1/√n)=lim_(n→∞) √n/(√n+1) =lim_(n→∞) 1/(1+1/√n)=1.

By te limi tomparison test since ∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/√n diverges, then ∑_(n=1)^∞ 1/(√n+1)  diverges

b. Compare this series to ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (2/3)ⁿ We see that
carto∑ₙ₌₁ⁿ₌₁(3/3), lim(n→∞)((2ⁿ+1)/3ⁿ)/(2ⁿ/3ⁿ)=lim(n→∞)(2ⁿ+1)/2ⁿ=lim(n→∞)[1+(1/2)ⁿ]=1

Therefore,

limₙ→∞ ((2ⁿ + 1)/3ⁿ)/(2ⁿ/3ⁿ) = 1

Since ∑ₙ₌₁∞ (⅔)ⁿ converges, we conclude that ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (2ⁿ+1)/3ⁿ converges

C. Since Inn $<n$ , compare with ∑_(n=1)^∞1/n .We see that
limₙ→∞ (ln n/n²)/(1/n) = limₙ→∞ (ln n)/n

In order to evaluate lim Inn/n, evaluate the limit as x→∞ of the real-valued function 
ln(x)/x These two limits are 月→00 equal, and making this change allows us to use L'Hopital's rule. We obtain

lim_(x→∞) (ln x)/x = lim_(x→∞) 1/x = 0.

Therefore, lim ln n/n=0 ,and, consequently, →00

lim_(n→∞) (ln n/n²)/(1/n) = 0

Since the limit is 0 but ∑_(n=1)^∞1/n diverges,the limit comparison test does not provide any information

Compare with ∑<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup>1/n² instead In this case

limₙ→∞(ln n/n²)/(1/n²) = limₙ→∞(ln n)/n² * n²/1 = limₙ→∞ ln n = ∞

Since the limit is ∞ but ∑_{n=1}^∞1/n² converges, the test still does not provide any information

So now we try a seresbetween the two we alreadytred. Choosing the series ∑_(n=1)^∞1/n^(3/2) ,we seethat
lim_(n→∞) (ln n/n²) / (1/n^(3/2)) = lim_(n→∞) (ln n)/√n.

As above, in rderto evaluate limₙ→∞ ln n/√n evluatethe limit as x→∞ of the relvalued function ln x/√x. Using

L'Hopital's rule,

lim_(x→∞) (ln x)/√x = lim_(x→∞) (2√x)/x = lim_(x→∞) 2/√x = 0

Since the limit is andl ∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/n^(3/2) converges, we can conclude that ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ ln n/n² converges

# 5.5 Alternating Series

## Learning Objectives

5.5.1Use the alternatinq series test to test an alternating series for converqence 5.5.2 Estimate the sum of an alternating series 5.5.3 Explain the meaning of absolute convergence and conditional convergence.

So far in this chapter, we have primarily discussed series with positive terms. In this section we introduce alternating series—those series whose terms alternate in sign. We will show in a later chapter that these series often arise when studying power series. After defining alternating series, we introduce the alternating series test to determine whether such a series converges.

### The Alternating Series Test.

A series whose terms alternate between positive and negative values is an alternating series.For example,the series

∑_(n=1)^∞(-1/2)^n = -1/2 + 1/4 - 1/8 + 1/16 - …

and

Σₙ₌₁^∞ (-1)ⁿ⁺¹/n = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ...

are both alternating series

### Definition

Any series whose terms alternate between positive and negative values is called an alternating series. An alternating series can be written in the form

∑ₙ₌₁∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹bₙ=b₁-b₂+b₃-b₄+…

or

∑ₙ₌₁∞(-1)ⁿbₙ = -b₁ + b₂ - b₃ + b₄ - …

Where $b_n>0$ for all positive integers n

Series (1), shown in Equation.5.11, is a geometric series.Since $|r|=|-1/2|<1$ , the series converges. Series (2), shown in Equation.5.12, is called the alternating harmonic series. We will show that whereas the harmonic series diverges, the alternating harmonic series converges.

To prove this,we look at the sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} (Figure 5.17)

## Proof

Consider the odd terms $S_{2k+1}$ for k ≥ 0 .Since $1/(2k+1)<1/2k$

S₂ₖ₊₁=S₂ₖ₋₁-1/(2k)+1/(2k+1)<S₂ₖ₋₁.

Therefore, {S₂ₖ₊₁} is a decreasing sequence. Also,

S₂ₖ₊₁ = (1 - ½) + (⅓ - ¼) + … + (1/(2k-1) - 1/(2k)) + 1/(2k+1) > 0.

Therefore, S₂ₖ₊₁ is bounded below. Since {S₂ₖ₊₁} is a decreasing sequence that is bounded below, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, { S₂ₖ₊₁ converges. Similarly, the even terms {S₂ₖ} form an increasing sequence that is

bounded above because

S₂ₖ = S₂ₖ₋₂ + 1/(2k-1) - 1/(2k) < S₂ₖ₋₂

and

S₂ₖ = 1 + (-1/2 + 1/3) + ... + (-1/(2k-2) + 1/(2k-1)) - 1/(2k) < 1.

Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence {S₂ₖ} also converges. Since

S₂ₖ₊₁ = S₂ₖ + 1/(2k + 1)

we know that

lim_(k→∞)S_(2k+1)=lim_(k→∞)S_(2k)+lim_(k→∞)1/(2k+1)

Letting S=lim S_(2k+1) and using the fact that 1/(2k + 1) → 0 ,we conclude that lim $S_{2k}=S$ .Since the odd terms and k→00 k→@

the even terms in the sequence of partial sums converge to the same limit $S$ it can be shown that the sequence of partial sums converges to $S$ , and therefore the alternating harmonic series converges to $S$

It can also be shown that S=ln2 ,and we can write

![](./images/fkLpZiH3hwBnEdGdeydxnNNdTbEcSIgT2.png)

Figure 5.17 For the alternating harmonic series, the odd terms $S_{2k+1}$ in the sequence of partial sums are decreasing and bounded below. The even terms $S_{2k}$ are increasing and bounded above.

口More generally, any alternating series of form (3) (Equation 5.13) or (4) (Equation 5.14) converges as long as b₁ ≥ b₂ ≥ b₃ ≥ ... and bₙ→0 (Figure 5.18). The proof is similar to the proof for the alternating harmonic series.

### Theorem 5.13

### Alternating Series Test

An alternating series of the form

∑_(n=1)^∞(-1)^(n+1)bₙ or ∑_(n=1)^∞(-1)^nbₙ

converges if

. 0<bₙ₊₁≤ lim<sub>n→∞</sub>b<sub>n</sub>=0. lim bₙ=0 0<bₙ₊₁≤bₙ foral n≥1 andl

This is known as the alternating series test.

We remark that this theorem is true more generally as long as there exists some integer $N$ such that 0<bₙ₊₁≤bₙ for all n ≥ N

## EXAMPLE 5.19

### Convergence of Alternating Series

For each of the following alternating series, determine whether the series converges or diverges.

a. Σₙ₌₁^∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹/n² b. ∑<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup>(-1)<sup>n+1</sup>n/(n+1)

### $①$ Solution a.Since

1/(n+1)²<1/n² and 1/n²→0,
the series converges.

b.Since  n/(n+1)→0  as n→∞ ,we cannot apply the alternating series test. Instead, we use the nth term test for

divergence. Since
limₙ→∞ ((-1)ⁿ⁺¹n)/(n+1) ≠ 0,

the series diverges.

 5.18Determine whether the series ∑_(n=1)^∞(-1)^(n+1)n/2ⁿ converges or diverges

### Remainder of an Alternating Series

It is difficult to explicitly calculate the sum of most alternating series, so typically the sum is approximated by using a partial sum.When doing so, we are interested in the amount of error in our approximation.Consider an alternating series

∑ₙ₌₁^∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹bₙ

satisfying the hypotheses of the alternating series test. Let $S$ denote the sum of this series and {Sₖ} bethe corresponding sequence of partial sums. From Figure 5.18, we see that for any integer N≥1 , the remainder $R_{N}$ satisfies

|Rₙ| = |S - Sₙ| ≤ |Sₙ₊₁ - Sₙ| = bₙ₊₁

### Theorem 5.14

### Remainders in Alternating Series

Consider an alternating series of theform

∑ₙ₌₁^∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹bₙ or ∑ₙ₌₁^∞(-1)ⁿbₙ

that satisfies the hypotheses of the alternating series test. Let S denote the sum of the series and $S_N$ denote theNth partial sum. For any integer N≥1 the remainder $R_{N}=S-S_{N}$ satisfies

|Rₙ| ≤ bₙ₊₁

In other words,if the conditions of the alternating series test apply, then the error in approximating the infinite series by the Nth partial sum $S_{N}$ is inmagnitude atmost the size of the next term $b_{N+1}$

### EXAMPLE 5.20

### Estimating the Remainder of an Alternating Series Consider the alternating series

∑_(n=1)^∞((-1)ⁿ⁺¹)/n²

Use the remainder estimate to determine a bound on the error $R_{10}$ if we approximate the sum of the series by the partial sum $S_{10}$

### $②$ Solution

From the theorem stated above,

|R₁₀| ≤ b₁₁ = 1/11² ≈ 0.008265

### Definition

A series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ exhibits absolute convergence if Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| converges. A series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ exhibits conditional convergence if ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges but Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| diverges

As shownby the alternating harmonic series a series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ may converge, but Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| may diverge. In the following theorem, however, we show that if Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges.

### Theorem 5.15

 Absolute Convergence Implies Convergence If Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges.

### Proof

Suppose thatlanl converges.We show this by using thefact that $a_n=|a_n|$ or $a_{n}=-|a_{n}|$ and therefore |aₙ| + aₙ = 2|aₙ| or |aη|+aη=0. Therefore, 0 ≤ |aₙ| + aₙ ≤ 2|aₙ| Consequently, by the comparison test, sinc 2∑<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup>|a<sub>n</sub>| converges, the series

∑_(n=1)^∞ (|aₙ| + aₙ)

converges. By using the algebraic properties for convergent series, we conclude that

∑_(n=1)^∞ aₙ = ∑_(n=1)^∞ (|aₙ|+aₙ) - ∑_(n=1)^∞ |aₙ|

converges.

## EXAMPLE 5.21

### Absolute versus Conditional Convergence For each of the following series, determine whether the series converges absolutely, converges conditionally, or

diverges.

a. ∑_(n=1)^∞ (-1)^(n+1)/(3n+1) b. ∑_{n=1}^∞cos(n)/n² の Solution

### a.We can see that

∑(from n=1 to ∞)|(-1)ⁿ⁺¹/(3n+1)| = ∑(from n=1 to ∞)1/(3n+1)

diverges by using the limit comparison test with the harmonic series
lim(n→∞)(1/(3n+1))/(1/n) = 1/3

Thus, applying Theorem 5.13, the series cannot converge absolutely. Moreover, because of the alternating series test, we can see that the series converges.
1/(3(n+1)+1) < 1/(3n+1) and 1/(3n+1) → 0,

We can conclude that ∑_(n=1)^∞ (-1)^(n+1)/(3n+1) converges conditionally b.Noting that |cosn] ≤1 ,to determine whether the series converges absolutely, compare

∑|cos n|/n² (n=1 to ∞)

with the series ∑ₙ₌₁∞1/n² Since ∑ₙ₌₁∞1/n² converges, by the comparison test, ∑ₙ₌₁^∞|cosn/n²| converges, and therefore ∑ₙ₌₁^∞cos n/n² converges absolutely

√2  5.20 Determine whether the series Σₙ₌₁∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹n/(2n³+1) converges absolutely, converges conditionally or diverges.

To see the difference between absolute and conditional convergence,look at what happens when we rearrange the

terms of the alternating harmonic series 
Σ_(n=1)^∞ (-1)^(n+1)/n We show that we can rearrange the terms so that the new series diverges. Certainly if we rearrange the terms of a finite sum, the sum does not change. When we work with ar infinite sum, however, interesting things can happen

Begin by adding enough of the positive terms to produce a sum that is larger than some real number $M>0$ .For example, let $M=10$ , and find an integer $k$ such that

1+1/3+1/5+…+1/(2k-1)>10

(We can do this because the series ∑ₙ₌₁^∞1/(2n−1) diverges to infinity.) Then subtract 1/2.Then ad more positiv terms until the sum reaches 1oo. That is, find another integer $j>k$ such that

1 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(2k - 1) - 1/2 + 1/(2k + 1) + ... + 1/(2j + 1) > 100

Then subtract 1/4.Continuing in this way,we have found a way of rearranqing the terms in the alternatingharmoni series so that the sequence of partial sums for the rearranged series is unbounded and therefore diverges

The terms in the alternating harmonic series can also be rearranged so that the new series converges to a different value. In Example 5.22, we show how to rearrange the terms to create a new series that converges to 3ln(2)/2 Wepoint out that the alternating harmonic series can be rearranged to create a series that converges to any real number $r$ however, the proof of that fact is beyond the scope of this text.

In general, any series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ that converges conditionallycan be rearranged so that the new serie diverges or converges to a different real number. A series that converges absolutely does not have this property. For any series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ that converges absolutel, the value of ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ isthe same for any rearrangement of the terms.This resultis known as the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem,which is beyond the scope of thisbook.

## EXAMPLE 5.22

### Rearranging Series

Use the fact that

1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - … = ln2

to rearrange the terms in the alternating harmonic series so the sum of the rearranged series is 3ln(2)/2

Let

Σₙ₌₁∞aₙ = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + 1/7 - 1/8 + …

Sine 
Σ_(n=1)^∞ aₙ = ln(2) yth aerai perie o overen er

∑ₙ₌₁∞ (1/2)aₙ = 1/2 - 1/4 + 1/6 - 1/8 + … = (1/2)∑ₙ₌₁∞ aₙ = (ln2)/2.

Now introduce te eries ∑ₙ₌₁bₙ such tht foral n≥1, b₂ₙ₋₁=0 and $b_{2n}=a_{n}/2$ Ther

∑_(n=1)^∞ bₙ=0+1/2+0-1/4+0+1/6+0-1/8+…=ln2/2.

 e a poee e ∑_(n=1)a_n and ∑ₙ₌₁bₙ converg heseres ∑_(n=1)(a_n+b_n) converges and

 Σₙ₌₁^∞(aₙ+bₙ) = Σₙ₌₁^∞aₙ + Σₙ₌₁^∞bₙ = ln2 + ln2/2 = (3ln2)/2 

Now adding the corresponding terms, $a_{n}$ and $b_n$ ,we see that

∑_{n=1}(aₙ+bₙ) = (1+0)+(-1/2+1/2)+(1/3+0)+(-1/4-1/4)+(1/5+0)+(-1/6+1/6)+… = 1+1/3-1/2+1/5+1/7-1/4+…

We notice that the series on the right side of the equal sign is a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series. Since

an+ bn)=31n(2)/2, we conclude that
![](./images/fVgqWhUBg9WoyiKdS5rx7YD6SEeDCM85S.png)

1+1/3-1/2+1/5+1/7-1/4+…=(3ln2)/2

Therefore,we have found a rearranqement of the alternating harmonic series having the desired property

## 5.6 Ratio and Root Tests

Learning Objectives

5.6.1Use the ratio test to determine absolute convergenceof a series. 5.6.2 Use theroot test to determine absolute convergence of a series. 5.6.3 Describe a strategy for testing the convergence of a given series.

In this section, we prove the last two series convergence tests: the ratio test and the root test. These tests are particularly nice because they do not require us to find a comparable series. The ratio test will be especially useful in the discussion of power seriesin the next chapter

Throughout this chapter, we have seen that no single convergence test works for all series. Therefore, at the end of this section we discuss a strateqy for choosinq which converqence test to use for a qiven series

### Ratio Test Cesie ∑_(n=1) aₙ. Pop lim aₙ = 0 1eoeae

for the series to converge.Not only do we need aₙ→0 ,but we need aₙ→0 quickly enough. For example, consider the serle ∑ₙ₌₁ ∑ₙ₌₁ In n eaes ∑_(n=1) 1/n² Wekete 1/n→0 dnde 1/n²→0 Hoesee ∑_(n=1)1/n² Cenes The series ∑ₙ₌₁ ∑ₙ₌₁ In diere caseth term n te euene {1/n} do not aprah eo ast enea a n→∞ Here we introduce the ratio test, which provides a way of measuring how fast the terms of a series approach zero.





### Solution

a.From the ratio test,we can see that

ρ=lim_(n→∞)(2^(n+1)/(n+1)!)/(2^n/n!)=lim_(n→∞)2^(n+1)/(n+1)!⋅n!/2^n

Since (n+1)!=(n+1)⋅n!

ρ=lim<sub>n→∞</sub>(2/(n+1))=0

Since ρ<1 , the series converges. b.We can see that

lim<sub>n→∞</sub>((n+1)<sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1)!)/(n<sup>n</sup>/n!) = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>((n+1)<sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1)!)·(n!/n<sup>n</sup>) = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>((n+1)/n)<sup>n</sup> = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>(1+1/n)<sup>n</sup> = e

Since ρ>1 ,the series diverges. C.Since

|((-1)^(n+1)((n+1)!)²/((2(n+1))!))/((-1)^n(n!)²/(2n)!)| = ((n+1)!(n+1)!)/((2n+2)!) * ((2n)!)/(n!n!) = ((n+1)(n+1))/((2n+2)(2n+1))

we see that

ρ = lim_(n→∞) [(n+1)(n+1)]/[(2n+2)(2n+1)] = 1/4

Since ρ<1 , the series converges.

5.21 Use the ratio est to determine whether the series ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ n³/3ⁿ converges or diverges

### Root Test

|aₙ|+|aₙ₊₁|+|aₙ₊₂|+…≈ρᴺ+ρᴺ⁺¹+ρᴺ⁺²+…

The exresson onth right-hand side is a geometric series.As in theratiotest,the series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges absolutely if 0≤ρ<1 and the series diverges if ρ≥1 If ρ=1 ,the test does not provide any information.For example for any seres ∑ₙ₌₁1/nᵖ we se hat

ρ = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>ⁿ√|1/n<sup>p</sup>| = lim<sub>n→∞</sub> 1/n<sup>p/n</sup>

To evaluate this limit, we use the natural logarithm function.Doing so. we see that
lnρ = ln(lim_(n→∞)(1/n^(p/n))) = lim_(n→∞)ln(1/n)^(p/n) = lim_(n→∞)(p/n)ln(1/n) = lim_(n→∞)(p ln(1/n))/n

Using L'Hopital's rule, it follows that lnρ = 0 , and therefore ρ=1 for all $p$ . However, we know that the $P$ -series only converges if $p>1$ and diverges if $p<1$

### Theorem 5.17

### Root Test

Consider the series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ . Let

ρ=limₙ→∞ⁿ√|aₙ|

i。If 0≤ρ<1, .then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges absolutely il。If ρ>1 or ρ=∞ , then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ diverges i.If ρ=1 ,the test does not provide any information.

The root test is useful for series whose terms involve exponentials. In particular, for a series whose terms $a_n$ satisfy $|a_n|=b_n^n$ ,then ⁿ√|aₙ|=bₙ and we need only evaluate lim bₙ $b_n$ bn → 00

### EXAMPLE 5.24

### Using the Root Test

For each of the following series, use the root test to determine whether the series converges or diverges

a. ∑ₙ₌₁^∞((n²+3n)ⁿ/(4n²+5)ⁿ) b. ∑ₙ₌₂∞nⁿ/(ln(n))ⁿ

### $①$ Solution

a.To apply the root test, we compute

ρ=limₙ→∞ⁿ√((n²+3n)ⁿ/(4n²+5)ⁿ)=limₙ→∞(n²+3n)/(4n²+5)=1/4

Since ρ<1 , the series converges absolutely

b.We have

ρ = lim (n→∞)ⁿ√(nⁿ/(ln n)ⁿ) = lim (n→∞) (n/ln n) = ∞ by L'Hôpital's rule.

Since ρ=∞ , the series diverges.

### Choosing a Convergence Test

At this point. we have a long list of convergence tests. However not all tests can be used for all series. when given . series,we must determine which test is the best to use. Here is a strategy for finding the best test to apply

b.Step 1.The series is not a familiar series. Step 2. The series is alternating. Since we are interested in absolute convergence, consider the series


Σ_(n=1)^∞ 3n/((n+1)!)

Step 3. The series is not similar to a $p$ -series or geometric series

Step 4. Since each term contains a factorial, apply the ratio test.We see that
limₙ→∞ (3(n+1))/(n+1)! / ((3n+1)/n!) = limₙ→∞ (3n+3)/(n+1)! * n!/(3n+1) = limₙ→∞ (3n+3)/((n+1)(3n+1)) = 0.

Therefore, this series converges, and we conclude that the original series converges absolutely,and thus converges c.Step 1. The series is not a familiar series. Step 2.It is not an alternating series.

Step 3. There is no obvious series with which to compare this series Step 4.There is no factorial. There is a power, but it is not an ideal situation for the root test Step 5. To apply the divergence test, we calculate that
lim_(n→∞)e^n/n³=∞

Therefore, by the divergence test, the series diverges. d.Step 1. This series is not a familiar series.

Step 2. It is not an alternating series. Step 3. There is no obvious series with which to compare this series Step 4.Since each term is a power of $n$ , we can apply the root test. Since
, we can apply the root test. Since lim(n→∞)ⁿ√((3/(n+1))ⁿ)=lim(n→∞)3/(n+1)=0,

by the root test, we conclude that the series converges.

## Series Converging toe π and 1/π

Dozens of series exist that converge to. π or an algebraic expression containing. π .Here we look at several examples and compare their rates of convergence. By rate of convergence, we mean the number of terms necessary for a partial sum to be within a certain amount of the actual value. The series representations of π in the first two examples can be explained using Maclaurin series, which are discussed in the next chapter. The third example relies on material beyond the scope of this text.

1.The series

π = 4∑_(n=1)^∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹/(2n-1) = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - ...

was discovered by Gregory and Leibnizin the late 1600s.This result follows from the Maclaurin series for f(x)=tan⁻¹x .We will discuss this series in the next chapter

a.Prove that this series converges b.Evaluate the partial sums $S_{n}$ for n = 10,20,50,100 C.Use theremainder estimate for alternating series to get a bound on the error $R_{n}$ d.What is the smallest value of $N$ that guarantees |R̃ₙ|<0.01? Evaluate $S_{N}$

2.The series

6∑ₙ₌₀^∞ (2n)!/(2⁴ⁿ⁺¹(n!)²(2n+1)) = 6(1/2 + 1/(2⋅3)(1/2)³ + (1⋅3)/(2⋅4⋅5)(1/2)⁵ + (1⋅3⋅5)/(2⋅4⋅6⋅7)(1/2)⁷ + …)

has been attributed to Newton in the late 1600s. The proof of this result uses the Maclaurin series for f(x)=arcsinx

a.Prove that the series converges. b.Evaluate the partial sums $S_n$ for $n=5,10,20$ c.Compare $S_n$ to π for $n=5,10,20$ and discuss the number of correct decimal places

3.The series

1/π=(√8/9801)∑<sub>n=0</sub><sup>∞</sup>(4n)!(1103+26390n)/((n!)⁴396<sup>4n</sup>)

was discovered by Ramanujan in the early 1900s. William Gosper, Jr., used this series to calculate π to an accuracy of more than 17 million digits in the mid-1980s.At the time.thatwas a world record.Since that time.this series and others by Ramanujan have led mathematicians to find many other series representations for π and 1/π

a.Prove that this series converges b.Evaluate the first term in thisseries.Compare thisnumber with thevalue of π from a calculating utility.Tc how many decimal places do these two numbers agree? What if we add the first two terms in the series? C.Investiqate the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan(1887-1920)and write a brief summary.Ramanujan is one of the most fascinating stories in the history of mathematics. He was basically self-taught, with no formal training in mathematics, yet he contributed in highly original ways to many advanced areas of mathematics

## Key Concepts

### 5.1 Sequences

·To determine the convergence of a sequence given by an explicit formula $a_{n}=f(n)$ ,we use the properties of limits for functions. ·If {aₙ} and {bₙ} are convergent sequences that converge to $A$ and $B$ respectively, and $c$ is any real number, ther the sequence {caₙ} converges to c·A ,the sequences {aₙ±bₙ} converge to A ± B ,the sequence {aₙ·bₙ} converges to A·B ,and the sequence {aₙ/bₙ:} converges to $A/B$ , provided 
B ≠ 0 If a sequence is bounded and monotone, then it converges,but not all convergent sequences are monotone. If a sequence is unbounded,it diverges,but not all divergent sequences are unbounded. The geometric sequence {rⁿ} converges if and only if $|r|<1$ or $r=1$

### 5.2 Infinite Series

·Given the infinite series

∑_{n=1}^∞ aₙ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + …

and the corresponding sequence of partial sums {Sₖ} where
Sₖ=∑ₙ₌₁ᵏaₙ=a₁+a₂+a₃+⋯+aₖ,

the series converges if and only if the sequence 
{S<sub>k</sub> } converges.

.The geometric series, a-I converges if $|r|<1$ and diverges if |r| ≥ 1. For $|r|<1$

∑_(n=1) arⁿ⁻¹ = a/(1-r).

The harmonic series

∑_{n=1}^∞1/n=1+1/2+1/3+…

diverges.

A series of the form
∩∑_(n=1)[b_n-b_(n+1)]=[b₁-b₂]+[b₂-b₃]+[b₃-b₄]+…+[b_n-b_(n+1)]+…

is a telescoping series. The kth partial sum of this series is given by $S_{k}=b_{1}-b_{k+1}$ .The series will converge if and only if lim bₖ₊₁ exists.In that case, K→→00

∑ₙ₌₁^∞[bₙ-bₙ₊₁]=b₁-limₖ→∞(bₖ₊₁).

### 5.3 The Divergence and Integral Tests

·f lim aₙ = 0 th serles ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ may cnverg rdiyerge

approximation $S_{N}$ is acurate up to an error $R_{N}$ where f(x)dx<RN<f(x)dx .The p-series ∑_{n=1}^∞1/n^p converges if $p>1$ and diverges if p ≤ 1

### 5.4 Comparison Tests

·The comparison tests are used to determine convergence or divergence of series with positive terms. When using the comparison tests, a series ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ is often compared to a geometric or $p$ -series

### 5.5 Alternating Series

For an alternating series=1)+1bnif b_(k+1)≤bₖ for all $k$ and bₖ→0 as k→∞ ,the alternating series converges.

·If Σₙ₌₁^∞|aₙ| converges, then ∑ₙ₌₁∞aₙ converges

### 5.6 Ratio and Root Tests

For the ratio test, we consider

ρ=limₙ→∞|aₙ₊₁/aₙ|.

ρ<1 the serie an converges absolutely. ρ>1 ,theseries diverges f ρ=1 ,the est doesnt provide any information. This test is useful for series whose terms involve factorials. For the root test,we consider

ρ=lim_(n→∞)ⁿ√|aₙ|

ρ<1 theserie ∑_(n=1)a_n covergsasoue e ρ>1 tesersiere e ρ=1 the s e ea information. The root test is useful for series whose terms involve powers For a series that is similar to a geometric series or $p-$ series,consider one of the comparison tests.

## Introduction

When winning a lottery, sometimes an individual has an option of receiving winnings in one lump-sum payment or receiving smaller payments over fixed time intervals. For example, you might have the option of receiving 20 million dollars today or receiving 1.5 million dollars each year for the next 20 years. Which is the better deal? Certainly 1.5 million dollars over 20 years is equivalent to 30 million dollars. However, receiving the 20 million dollars today would allow you to invest the money.

Alternatively, what if you were guaranteed to receive 1 million dollars every year indefinitely (extending to your heirs) or receive 20 million dollars today. Which would be the better deal? To answer these questions, you need to know how to use infinite series to calculate the value of periodic payments over time in terms of today's dollars (see Example 6.7).

An nnl eieo e om ∑(∞, n=0) cₙxⁿ I a e e ea e e e e can be used to define functions. They can be used to represent given functions, but they are also important because they

allow us to write functions that cannot be expressed any other way than as “infinite polynomials." In addition, power series can be easily differentiated and integrated, thus being useful in solving differential equations and integrating complicated functions. An infinite series can also be truncated, resulting in a finite polynomial that we can use to

approximate functional values. Power series have applications in a variety of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology and economics. As we will see in this chapter, representing functions using power series allows us to solve mathematica problems that cannot be solved with other techniques

# 6.1 Power Series and Functions.

### Learning Objectives

6.1.1Identify a power series and provide examples of them. 6.1.2 Determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of a power series. 6.1.3 Use a power series to represent a function.

A power series is a type of series with terms involving a variable. More specifically, if the variable is xμ then all the terms of the series involve powers of x. As a result, a power series can be thought of as an infinite polynomial. Power series are used to represent common functions and also to define new functions. In this section we define power series and show how to determine when a power series converges and when it diverges.We also show how to represent certain functions using power series.

## Form of a Power Series

A series of the form

∑ₙ₌₀^∞cₙxⁿ = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + …,

where $x$ is a variable and the coefficients $c_{n}$ are constants,is known as a power series.The series

1+x+x²+…=∑_(n=0)^∞xⁿ

is an example of a power series. Since this series is a geometric series with ratio $r=x.$ we know that it converges if $|x|<1$ and diverges if |x|≥1

### Definition

A series of the form

∑ₙ₌₀^∞cₙxⁿ = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + …

is a power series centered at $x=0.$ A series of the form


Σ_(n=0)^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ = c₀ + c₁(x-a) + c₂(x-a)² + ...

is a power series centered at $X=u$

To make this definition precise, we stipulate that $x^0=1$ and $(x-a)^{0}=1$ even when $x=0$ and $x=a$ , respectively The series

∑ₙ₌₀^∞xⁿ/n!=1+x+x²/2!+x³/3!+…

and

∑_(n=0)^∞n!xⁿ=1+x+2!x²+3!x³+…

are both power series centered at $x=0$ . The series

∑_(n=0)^∞ (x-2)^n/((n+1)3^n) = 1+(x-2)/(2*3)+(x-2)²/(3*3²)+(x-2)³/(4*3³)+…

is a power series centered at $x=2$

### Convergence of a Power Series

Since the terms in a power series involve a variable $x$, the series may converge for certain values of $x$ and diverge for other values of $x.$ For a power series centered at $x=a$ , the value of the series at $x=a$ is given by $c_0$ . Therefore, a power series always converges at its center. Some power series converge only at that value of $x.$ Most power series, however, converge for more than one value of $x.$ In that case, the power series either converges for all real numbers $x$ or

converges forall in a inie inteval. For example,the geometric series ≥ x" converges for al $x$ in the interval (-1, 1) but diverges for all $x$ outside that interval. We now summarize these three possibilities for a general power series

### Theorem 6.1

### Convergence of a Power Series

Considr the pwer series ∑(n=0)cₙ(x-a)^n. The series stses eaty ene o the folowing properties

i.The series converges at $x=a$ and diverges for all x ≠ a ii.The series converges for all real numbers $x.$ ili.There exists a real number $R>0$ such that the series converges if $|x-a|<R$ and diverges if $|x-a|>R.$ At the values xwhere $|x-a|=R$ ,the series may converge or diverge.

3. cₙdⁿ→0 as n→∞ .Terefore there eists n nteger such that |cₙdⁿ| ≤ 1 for all n≥N Writing

|cₙxⁿ|=|cₙdⁿ|(|x/d|)ⁿ,

we conclude that, for all n ≥ N

|cₙxⁿ| ≤ |x/d|ⁿ

The series

∑_(n=N)^∞|x/d|ⁿ

is a geometric eres that converges if |x/d|<1 Therefore, by te comparisontest, we cnclude that Cn x" alsc converges for $| x| < | d|$ . Since we can add a finite number of terms to a convergent series, we conclude that cnx? ∑ₙ₌₀cₙxⁿ converges for $|x|<|d|$

With this result. we can now prove the theorem. Consider the series

∑ₙ₌₀^∞ aₙxⁿ

and let S be the set of real numbers for which the series converges. Suppose that the set S={0} Then the series falls under case i. Suppose that the set 5 is the set of all real numbers. Then the series falls under case i. Suppose that S≠{0} and Sis not the set of real numbers. Then there exists a real number x^k≠0 such that the series does not converge. Thus, the series cannot converge for any x such that $|x|>|x^{*}|.$ Therefore, the set S must be a bounded set which means that it must have a smallest upper bound.(This fact follows from the Least Upper Bound Property for the real numbers, which is beyond the scope of this text and is covered in real analysis courses.) Call that smallest upper bound R. Since S≠{0} ,the number $R>0$ . Therefore, the series converges for all x such that. $|x|<R$ ,and the series falls into case iii

To determine the interval of convergence for a power series, we typically apply the ratio test. In Example 6.1, we show the three different possibilities illustrated in Figure 6.2

### EXAMPLE 6.1

### Finding the Interval and Radius of Convergence

For each of the following series, find the interval and radius of convergence.

![](./images/fktAmbxGeYZEbgGeQr41CbiGKyi6AZRcz.png)

![](./images/fWbdxhvDCDk02gdQ0Ak93tcTBLFZbf5zX.png)

### Solution

a.To check for convergence,apply the ratio test.We have

ρ = lim_(n→∞)|xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)! * n!/xⁿ| = lim_(n→∞)|x/(n+1)| = |x|lim_(n→∞)1/(n+1) = 0<1

for all valuesof $x.$ Therefore, the series converges for all real numbers x.The interval of convergence is (-oo o and the radius of convergence is R=∞

b.Apply the ratio test.For x≠0 ,we see that

ρ = lim_(n→∞)|(n+1)!xⁿ⁺¹/(n!xⁿ)| = lim_(n→∞)|(n+1)x| = |x|lim_(n→∞)(n+1) = ∞

Therefore, the series diverges for all x≠0 . Since the series is centered at $x=0$ ,it must converge there, so the series converges only for $x=0$ . The interval of convergence is the single value $x=0$ and theradius of convergence is $R=0$

C.In order to apply the ratio test, consider

p=lim_(n→∞)|((x-2)^(n+1))/((n+2)3^(n+1)))/((x-2)^n/((n+1)3^n))|=lim_(n→∞)|((x-2)^(n+1))/((n+2)3^(n+1))*((n+1)3^n)/((x-2)^n)|=lim_(n→∞)|(x-2)(n+1)/(3(n+2))|=|x-2|/3

The ratio ρ<1 if $|x-2|<3.$ Since $|x-2|<3$ implies that $-3<x-2<3$ ,the series converges absolutely if $-1<x<5$ The ratio ρ>1 if $|x-2|>3.$ Therefore, the series diverges if $x<-1$ or $x>5$ The ratio test is inconclusive if ρ=1 The ratio ρ=1 if and only if $x=-1$ or $x=5.$ We need to test these values of $x$ separately.For $x=-1$ , the series is given by

∑ₙ₌₀∞ (-1)ⁿ/(n+1) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + …

Since this is the alternating harmonic series, it converges. Thus, the series converges at $x=-1$ . For $x=5$ ,the series is given by

∑(from n=0 to ∞)1/(n+1)=1+1/2+1/3+1/4+...

This is the harmonic series, which is divergent. Therefore, the power series diverges at $x=5$ Weconclude that the interval of convergence is[-1,5) and the radius of convergence is $R=3$

### Representing Functions as Power Series

Being able to represent a function by an “infinite polynomial" is a powerful tool. Polynomial functions are the easiest functions to analyze, since they only involve the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If we can represent a complicated function by an infinite polynomial, we can use the polynomial representation to differentiate orintegrate it. In addition,we can use a truncated version of the polynomial expression to approximate values of the function. So, the question is, when can we represent a function by a power series?

Consider aqain the qeometric series

1+x+x²+x³+⋯=∑ₙ₌₀∞xⁿ

Recall that the qeometric series

a + ar + ar² + ar³ + …

converges if and only if |r| < 1 In that case,it converges to a/(1-r) .Therefore, if $|x|<1$ ,the series in Example 6.3 converges to 1/(1-x) and we write

1+x+x²+x³+…=1/(1-x) for |x|<1

As a result, we are able to represent the function f(x) = 1/(1 - x) by the power series

1+x+x²+x³+… when |x|<1.

We now show graphicalyhow thisseries provides a representation for the function f(x)=1/(1-x) by comparing the graph of fwith the graphs of several of the partial sums of this infinite series.

Next we consider functions involving an expression similar to the sum of a geometric series and show how to represent these functions using power series.

## EXAMPLE 6.3

### Representing a Function with a Power Series

Use a power series to represent each of the following functions $f$ Find the interval of convergence.

a. f(x) = 1/(1+x³) b. f(x) = x²/(4-x²)

### $②$ Solution

a.You should recoqnize this function $f$ as the sum of a qeometric series, because
1/(1+x³)=1/(1-(-x³))

Using the fact that, for |r|<1, a/(1-r) is the sum of the geometric series

∑_{n=0}^∞ arⁿ = a + ar + ar² + …

we see that, for |-x³|<1

1/(1+x³)=1/(1-(-x³))=∑_(n=0) (-x³)^n=1-x³+x⁶-x⁹+⋯

Since this series converges if and only if |-x³|<1 ,the interval of convergence is (-1,1) , and we have

1/(1+x³)=1-x³+x⁶-x⁹+⋯ for $|x|<1$

b.This function is not in the exact form of a sum of a geometric series. However, with a little algebraic manipulation, we canrelate fto a geometric series.By factoring 4 out of the two terms in the denominator, we obtain
oring4outofthetwoterm x²/4-x² = x²/[4(1-x²/4)] = x²/[4(1-(x/2)²)].

Therefore, we have

x²/4-x² = x²/[4(1-(x/2)²)] = (x²/4)/[1-(x/2)²] = Σₙ₌₀^∞(x²/4)(x/2)²ⁿ

The series converges as long as |(x/2)²|<1 (notethat when |(x/2)²|=1 the series does not converge).Solving this inequality, we conclude that the interval of convergence is (-2,2) ano

V x²/4-x² = Σₙ₌₀^∞ x²ⁿ⁺²/4ⁿ⁺¹ = x²/4 + x⁴/4² + x⁶/4³ + …

for $|x|<2$

 6.3 Represent the function f(x)=x³/ (2-x) using a power serie and fin the interval o convergence

In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will show ways of deriving power series representations for many other functions, and how we can make use of these representations to evaluate, differentiate, and integrate various functions.

# 6.2 Properties of Power Series.

## Learning Objectives

6.2.1Combine power series by addition or subtraction. 6.2.2 Create a new power series by multiplication by a power of the variable or a constant, or by substitution

6.2.3Multiply two power series together 6.2.4 Differentiate and integrate power series term-by-term

In the preceding section on power series and functions we showed how to represent certain functions using power series. In this section we discuss how power series can be combined, differentiated, or integrated to create new power series. This capability is particularly useful for a couple of reasons. First, it allows us to find power series representations for certain elementary functions, by writing those functions in terms of functions with known power series. For example given the power series representation for f(x)=1/(1-x) , we can find a power series representation fore f'(x)=1/(1-x)² Second, being able to create power series allows us to define new functions that cannot be written in terms of elementary functions. This capability is particularly useful for solving differential equations for which there is no solution in terms of elementary functions.

## Combining Power Series

If we have two power series with the same interval of convergence, we can add or subtract the two series to create a new power series, also with the same interval of convergence. Similarly, we can multiply a power series by a power of $X$ or evaluate apower series at $x^{m}$ for a positive integer m to create a new power series. Being able to do this allows us to find power series representations for certain functions by using power series representations of other functions. For example, since we know the power series representation for f(x)=1/(1-x) ,we can find power series representations for related functions, such as.

y = 3x/(1 - x²) and y = 1/((x - 1)(x - 3))

In Combining_Power Series we state results regarding addition or subtraction of power series, composition of a powe series,and multiplication of a power series by a power of the variable.For simplicity,we state the theorem for power series centered at $x=0.$ Similar results hold for power series centered at $x=a$

we conclude that the seres ∑_{n=0}(c_{n}x^{n}+d_{n}x^{n}) converges to $f(x)+g(x)$

口We examine products of power series in a later theorem.First,we show several applications of Combining_PowerSerie and how to find the interval of convergence of a power series given the interval of convergence of a related power series.

In the next example, we show how to use Combining Power Series and the power series for a function fto construct power series for functions related to $f.$ Specifically, we consider functions related to the function f(x)=1/(1-x) and we use the fact that

1/(1-x)=∑ₙ₌₀^∞xⁿ=1+x+x²+x³+…

for $|x|<1.$

### EXAMPLE 6.5

### Constructing Power Series from Known Power Series Use the power series representation for f(x)=1/(1-x) combined with Combining Power Series to construct a power series

for each of the following functions.Find theinterval of convergence of thepowerseries

a. f(x)=3x/(1+x²) b. f(x)=1/((x-1)(x-3))

### $①$ Solution

a.First write f(x) as

f(x) = 3x(1/(1 - (-x²)))

Using the power series representation for f(x)=1/(1-x) and parts i. and ii.of Combining Power Series, we find that apower seriesrepresentation for fis given by

∑<sub>n=0</sub><sup>∞</sup>3x(-x²)ⁿ=∑<sub>n=0</sub><sup>∞</sup>3(-1)ⁿx²ⁿ⁺¹

Since the interval of convergence of the series for 1/(1-x) is (-1,1) ,the interval of convergence for this new series is the set of real numbers x such that |x²|<1 Therefore, the interval of convergence is (-1,1) b. To find the pwer series representatio, use patil fractions to write f(x) = 1/((x-1)(x-3)) as thesum of two fratons

We have

1/(x-1)(x-3) = -1/2/(x-1) + 1/2/(x-3) = 1/2/(1-x) - 1/2/(3-x) = 1/2/(1-x) - 1/6/(1-x/3)

First. using part ii. of Combining Power Series,we obtair

(1/2)/(1-x)=∑_{n=0}^∞(1/2)xⁿ for |x|<1

Then, using parts ii. and ii. of Combining Power Series, we have

1/(6/(1-x/3))=∑_{n=0}^∞(1/6)(x/3)^n for |x|<3.

Since we are combining these two power series, the interval of convergence of the difference must be the smaller of these two intervals.Using this fact and part i.of Combining Power Series,we have

1/((x-1)(x-3))=∑_{n=0}^∞(1/2 - 1/(6*3^n))x^n

where the interval of convergence is (-1,1)

6.5 Use the series for f(x) = 1/(1 - x) on $|x|<1$ to construct a series for 1/((1-x)(x-2)) . Determine the interval oft convergence.

In Example 6.5, we showed how to find power series for certain functions. In Example 6.6 we show how to do the opposite: given a power series, determine which function it represents.

### EXAMPLE 6.6

Writing the given series as

Since this is a geometric series, the series converges if and only if $|2x|<1.$ Therefore, the interval of convergence is (-1/2,1/2)

Recallthe questions posed in the chapter opener about which is the better way of receiving payouts from lottery winnings. We now revisit those questions and show how to use series to compare values of payments over time with a lump sum payment today. We will compute how much future payments are worth in terms of today's dollars, assuming

we have the ability to invest winninqs and earn interest.The value of future payments in terms of today's dollars is known as the present value of those payments.

### EXAMPLE 6.7

Chapter Opener:Present Value of Future Winnings

![](./images/fkGGQZL8ytenVwGFG7f5BzuiaODaEcs52.png)

Suppose you win the lottery and are given the following three options: (1) Receive 20 million dollars today; (2) receive 1.5 million dollars per year over the next 20 years; or (3) receive 1 million dollars per year indefinitely (being passed on to your heirs). Which is the best deal, assuming that the annual interest rate is 5967 We answer this by working through the following sequence of questions.

a.How much is the 1.5 million dollars received annually over the course of 20 years worth in terms of today's dollars, assuming an annual interest rate of 5967 b.Use the answer to part a.to find a general formula for the present value of payments of $C$ dollars received each yea over the next n years, assuming an average annual interest rate r C.Find a formula for the present value if annual payments of C dollars continue indefinitely, assuming an average annual interest rate r. d.Use the answer to part c. to determine the present value of 1 million dollars paid annually indefinitely e.Use your answers to parts a. and d. to determine which of the three options is best

## $②$ Solution

a.Consider the payment of 1.5 million dollars made at the end of the first year. If you were able to receive that payment today instead of one year from now, you could invest that money and earn 596 interest. Therefore, the present value of that money $P_1$ satisfies P $i(1+0.05)=1.5$ million dollars. We conclude that

P₁ = 1.5/1.05 =1.429$ milon dolars

Similarly, consider the payment of 1.5 million dollars made at the end of the second year If you were able to receive that payment today, you could invest that money for two years, earning 596 interest, compounded annually Therefore, the present value of that money $P_2$ satisfies $P_{2}(1+0.05)^{2}=1.5$ million dollars. We conclude that


P₂ = 1.5/(1.05)² = 1.361$ milion dolars

The value of the future payments today is the sum of the present values $P_{1},P_{2},...,P_{20}$ of each of those annual payments. The present value $P_k$ satisfies

Pₖ=1.5/(1.05)ᵏ

Therefore,

P=1.5/1.05+1.5/(1.05)²+…+1.5/(1.05)²⁰=S18.693 million dollars.

b.Using the result from part a. we see that the present value $P$ of $C$ dollars paid annually over the course of n years assuming an annual interest rate $r$, is given by
P = C/(1+r) + C/(1+r)² + ... + C/(1+r)ⁿ dollars

c. Using the result from part b. we see that the present value of an annuity that continues indefinitely is given by the infinite series

P=∑ₙ₌₀^∞ C/(1+r)ⁿ⁺¹

We can view the present value as a power series in $r.$ which converges as long as< 1. Since $r>0$ ,this serie converges. Rewriting the series as.

P = C/(1+r)Σₙ₌₀∞ (1/(1+r))ⁿ,

we recognize this series as the power series for
f(r) = 1/(1 - 1/(1+r)) = 1/(r/(1+r)) = (1+r)/r

We conclude that the present value of this annuity is

P=C/(1+r)*(1+r)/r=C/r.

d.From the result to part c. we conclude that the present value $P$ of $C=1$ million dollars paid out every year indefinitely, assuming an annual interest rate $r=0.05$ , is given by
P=1/0.05=20 million dollars.

e.From part a.we see that receiving <1.5million dollars over the course of 20 years is worth 18.693 million dollars in today's dollars. From part d. we see that receiving 年1 million dollars per year indefinitely is worth <20$ million dollars in today's dollars. Therefore, either receiving a lump-sum payment of $s20$ million dollars today or receiving <1$ million dollars indefinitely have the same present value.

## Multiplication of Power Series

We can also create newpower series by multiplying power series.Being able to multiply twopower series provides another way of finding power series representations for functions

The way we multiply them is similar to how we multiply polynomials. For example, suppose we want to multiply

∑_{n=0}^∞ cₙxⁿ = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + ...

and

∑_{n=0}^{∞}dₙxⁿ=d₀+d₁x+d₂x²+…

It appears that the product should satisfy
(∑_{n=0}^∞ cₙxⁿ)(∑_{n=0}^∞ dₙxⁿ) = (c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + ...)(d₀ + d₁x + d₂x² + ...) = c₀d₀ + (c₁d₀ + c₀d₁)x + (c₂d₀ + c₁d₁ + c₀d₂)x² + ...

IMu ∑(∞, n=0) cₙxⁿ and ∑ₙ₌₀dₙxⁿ ceneoae $I_{r}$ teeee

converges on the interval I.

### Theorem 6.3

Then

and

∑_{n=0}^∞ eₙxⁿ converges to f(x)⋅g(x) on I.

We omit the proof of this theorem, as it is beyond the level of this text and is typically covered in a more advancec course. We now provide an example of this theorem by finding the power series representation for

f(x) = 1/((1-x)(1-x²))

using the power series representations for

y=1/(1-x) and y=1/(1-x²)

# EXAMPLE 6.8

### Multiplying Power Series

Multiply the power series representation


1/(1-x) = Σ_(n=0)^∞ xⁿ = 1 + x + x² + x³ + ...

for $|x|<1$ with the power series representation

1/(1-x²) = ∑_(n=0) (x²)^n = 1+x²+x⁴+x⁶+…

for $|x|<1$ to construct a power seriesfor f(x) = 1/((1-x)(1-x²)) on the inteval (-1,1)

![](./images/fUnQdOs1Mtg6NzGSRm9wXscmG02PXoiLb.png)

### Solution

We need to multiply

(1+x+x²+x³+…)(1+x²+x⁴+x⁶+…)

Writing out the first several terms, we see that the product is given by
1 + (1+x²+x⁴+x⁶+…)+(x+x³+x⁵+x⁷+…)+(x²+x⁴+x⁶+x⁸+…)+(x³+x⁵+x⁷+x⁹+…) = 1+x+2x²+2x³+3x⁴+3x⁵+…

Since the series for y = and y = both converge on the interval (-1,1) , the series for the product alsc converges on the interval (-1,1)

### Differentiating and Integrating Power Series

Conside a owe eles ∑_(n=0) cₙxⁿ = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + ... tat convergeson someineie $I.$ andlet $f$ bete funciorn defined by this series. Here we address two questions about $f$

·Is $f$ differentiable, and if so, how do we determine the derivative 
f' ? How do we ealuate th indefinite integral! ∫f(x)dx?

We know that, for a polynomial with a finite number of terms, we can evaluate the derivative by differentiating each term separately. Similarly, we can evaluate the indefinite integral by integrating each term separately. Here we show that we can do the same thing for convergent power series. That is, if

f(x)=∑_(n=1)^∞ cₙxⁿ=c₀+c₁x+c₂x²+⋯

converges on some interval $I_r$ then

f'(x)=c₁+2c₂x+3c₃x²+…

and

∫f(x) dx = C + c₀x + c₁x²/2 + c₂x³/3 + …

converges on I. As noted below, behavior at the endpoints of the interval must be investigated individually

Evaluating the derivative and indefinite integral in this way iscalled term-by-term differentiation of a power series and term-by-term integration of a power series, respectively. The ability to differentiate and integrate power series term-by-term also allows us to use known power series representations to find power series representations for other functions.For example, given the power series for f(x)=1/(1-x) , we can differentiate term-by-term to find the power series for f'(x)=1/(1-x)² Similarly, using the power series for 
g(x) = 1/(1+x) we can integrate term-by-term to find the power series for G(x)=ln(1+x), an antiderivative of $g$ We show how to do this in Example 6.9 and Example 6.10 First, we state Term-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series, which provides the main result regarding differentiation and integration of power series.

### Theorem 6.4

### Term-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series

Suppose that the power series≥ cn(x - a)" converges on the interval $(a-R,a+R)$ for some $R>0.$ Let fbe the ∑ₙ₌₀cₙ(x-a)ⁿ function defined by the series

f(x)=∑_(n=0)^∞cₙ(x-a)ⁿ=c₀+c₁(x-a)+c₂(x-a)²+c₃(x-a)³+⋯

for $|x-a|<R.$ Then fis differentiable on the interval $(a-R,a+R)$ and we can find f' by differentiating the series term-by-term:

f'(x) = Σₙ₌₁^∞ ncₙ(x-a)ⁿ⁻¹ = c₁ + 2c₂(x-a) + 3c₃(x-a)² + …

for $|x-a|<R$ Also, to find ∫f(x) $dx$ . we can integrate the series term-by-term. The resulting series converges on (a-R, a+R), and we have

∫f(x)dx=C+∑ₙ₌₀cₙ(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) =C+c₀(x-a)+c₁(x-a)²/2+c₂(x-a)³/3+…

for $|x-a|<R$

The proof of this result is beyond the scope of the text and is omitted. Note that although Term-by-Term Differentiation and Inteqration forPower Series guarantees the same radius of convergence when a power series is differentiated or inteqrated term-by-term,it says nothing about what happens at the endpoints.It is possible that the differentiated and integrated power series have different behavior at the endpoints than does the original series.We see this behavior in the next examples.

## EXAMPLE 6.9

### Differentiating Power Series a.Use the power series representation

f(x) = 1/(1-x) = Σₙ₌₀ xⁿ = 1 + x + x² + x³ + …

for $|x|<1$ to find a power series representation for

g(x) = 1/(1-x)² 

on the interval (-1,1). Determine whether the resulting series converges at the endpoints

s∑ₙ₌₀^∞(n+1)/4ⁿ
b.Use the result of part a. to evaluate the sum of the series

### $②$ Solution a. Since g(x)=1/(1-x)² is the derivative of f(x)=1/(1-x) , we can find a power series representation for $g$ by

differentiating the power series for fterm-by-term. The result is

LCITIPDY tcinii.micicsuitis g(x) = 1/(1-x)² = d/dx(1/(1-x)) = ∑ₙ₌₀^∞d/dx(xⁿ) = d/dx(1+x+x²+x³+⋯) = 0+1+2x+3x²+4x³+⋯ 00 = ∑ₙ₌₀(n+1)xⁿ

for $|x|<1$, Ierm-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series does not guarantee anything about the behavior of this series at the endpoints. Testing the endpoints by using the divergence test, we find that the series diverges at both endpoints x = ±1 Note that this is the same result found in Example 6.8

b.From part a. we know that

∑ₙ₌₀^∞(n+1)xⁿ = 1/(1-x)²

Therefore,

00 Σₙ₌₀ (n+1)/4ⁿ = Σₙ₌₀(n+1)(1/4)ⁿ = 1/(1-1/4)² = 1/(3/4)² = 16/9.

## EXAMPLE 6.10

### Integrating Power Series

For each of the following functions $f_{i}$ find a power seriesrepresentation for fbyintegrating the power series for f' and find its interval of convergence

a. f(x) = ln(1+x) b. f(x)=tan⁻¹x

### $②$ Solution

a.For f(x)=ln(1+x), the derivative is f'(x) = 1/(1+x) -  We know tha
1/(1+x) = 1/(1-(-x)) = ∑ₙ₌₀(-x)ⁿ = 1 - x + x² - x³ + …

for $|x|<1.$ To find a power series for f(x)=ln(1+x). we integrate the series term-by-term
oror j (A)-in(1|A), ne micogruic tiic scics tci ∫f'(x)dx = ∫(1-x+x²-x³+…)dx = C+x-x²/2+x³/3-x⁴/4+…

Since f(x) = ln(1+x) is an antiderivative of 1/(1+x) , it remains to solve for the constant $C.$ Since In (1+0)=0 ,we have $C=0.$ Therefore, a power series representation for f(x) = ln(1+x) is
s lepresentation lor y(x)=ln(1+x) s ln(1+x)=x-x²/2+x³/3-x⁴/4+…=∑_(n=1)^∞(-1)ⁿ⁺¹xⁿ/n

for $|x|<1$ Term-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series does not guarantee anything about the behavior of this power series at the endpoints. However, checking the endpoints, we find that at $x=1$ the series is the alternating harmonic series, which converges. Also, at $x=-1$ , the series is the harmonic series, which diverges. It is important to note that,even though this series converges at $x=1$ , Term-by-Term Differentiation ande Integration for Power Series does not guarantee that the series actually converges to In (2). In fact, the series does

converge to In (2), but showing this fact requires more advanced techniques. (Abel's theorem, covered in more advanced texts, deals with this more technical point.) The interval of converqence is (-1,11 b. The derivative of f(x) = tan⁻¹x is 
f'(x) = 1/(1+x²)  .We know that

(1+x²)/(1+x²) = 1/(1-(-x²)) =∑_{n=0}(-x²)ⁿ =1-x²+x⁴-x⁶+…

for $|x|<1$, To find a power series for f(x) = tan⁻¹x, we integrate this series term-by-term

f(x) = arctanx, we write its series term xⁿ ∫f’(x)dx = ∫(1 - x² + x⁴ - x⁶ + …)dx = C + x - x³/3 + x⁵/5 - x⁷/7 + …

Since tan⁻¹(0)=0 ,wehave $C=0$ . Therefore, a power series representation for f(x) = tan⁻¹x is
tan⁻¹x = x - x³/3 + x⁵/5 - x⁷/7 + … = Σ(-1)ⁿx²ⁿ⁺¹/(2n+1)

for $|x|<1$ . Again, Term-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series does not guarantee anything about the convergence of this series at the endpoints. However, checking the endpoints and using the alternating series test,wefind that the seriesconverges at $x=1$ and $x=-1$ .As discussed in part a.,using Abel's theorem,it canbe shown that the series actually convergesto tan⁻¹ (1) and tan⁻¹ (-1) at $x=1$ and $x=-1$ , respectively. Thus, the interval of convergenceis [-1,1]

6.9
Integrate the power series ln(1+x) = Σ_(n=1)^∞ (-1)^(n+1)xⁿ/n term-by-term to evaluate ∫ln(1+x)dx.

Up to this point, we have shown several techniques for finding power series representations for functions. However, how do we know that these power series are unique? That is, qiven a function fand a power series for fat a, is it possible that there is a different power series for $f$ ata thatwe could have found if wehad used a different technique?The answer to this questionis no.Thisfact shouldnot seem surprising if we think of power series as polynomials with an infinite number of terms. Intuitively,if

c₀+c₁x+c₂x²+⋯=d₀+d₁x+d₂x²+⋯

for all values $x$ in some open interval Iabout zero, then the coefficients $c_n$ should equal $d_n$ for n ≥ 0 Wenowstate this result formally in Uniqueness of Power Series.

### Theorem 6.5

### Uniqueness of Power Series

Le on(x al and ∑_{n=0}dₙ(x-a)ⁿ be wo coverget wersele uet hht

∑ₙ₌₀ cₙ(x - a)ⁿ = ∑ₙ₌₀ dₙ(x - a)ⁿ

for all x in an open interval containing a. Then $c_n=d_n$ for all n≥0

### Proof

Let

f(x) = c₀ + c₁(x-a) + c₂(x-a)² + c₃(x-a)³ + … = d₀ + d₁(x-a) + d₂(x-a)² + d₃(x-a)³ + …

Then f(a)=c₀=d₀ . By Term-by-Term Differentiation and Integration for Power Series, we can differentiate both series term-by-term. Therefore,

f'(x) = c₁ + 2c₂(x-a) + 3c₃(x-a)² + ... = d₁ + 2d₂(x-a) + 3d₃(x-a)² + ...

and thus, f' f' f'(a) = c₁ = d₁ . Similarly


f''(x) = 2c₂ + 3⋅2c₃(x-a) + ... = 2d₂ + 3⋅2d₃(x-a) + ...

implies that f''(a) = 2c₂ = 2d₂ ,and therefore, $c_{2}=d_{2}$ . More generally, for any integer n≥0, f⁽ⁿ⁾(a) = n!cₙ = n!dₙ and consequently, $c_{n}=d_{n}$ for all n≥0

In this section we have shown how to find power series representations for certain functions using various algebraic operations, differentiation, or integration.At this point,however, we are stillimited as to the functions for which we can find power series representations. Next, we show how to find power series representations for many more functions by introducing Taylor series

# 6.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series

6.3.2 Explain the meaning and significance of Taylor's theorem with remainder 6.3.3Estimate the remainder for a Taylor series approximation of a given function.

In the previous two sections we discussed how to find power series representations for certain types of functions--specifically, functions related to geometric series. Here we discuss power series representations for other types of functions. In particular, we address the following questions: Which functions can be represented by power series and how do we find such representations? If we can find a power series representation for a particular function $f$ and the series converges on some interval, how do we prove that the series actually converges to $f?$

# Overview of Taylor/Maclaurin Series

Consider a function $f$ that has a power series representation at $x=a$ ,Then the series has the form

∑_(n=0)^∞cₙ(x-a)ⁿ=c₀+c₁(x-a)+c₂(x-a)²+…

What should the coefficients be?For now, we ignore issues of convergence,but instead focus on what the series should be, if one exists. We return to discuss convergence later in this section. If the series Equation 6.4 is a representation for $f$ at $x=a$ , we certainly want the series to equal $f(a)$ at $X=4$ Evaluating the series at $x=a$ , we see that

∑_{n=0}cₙ(x-a)ⁿ = c₀ + c₁(a-a) + c₂(a-a)² + … = c₀

Thus, the series equals $f(a)$ if the coefficient $c_{0}= f( a)$ . In addition, we would like the first derivative of the powe series to equal f' (a) at $x=a$ . Differentiating Equation 6.4 term-by-term, we see that

d/dx(∑_{n=0}^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = c₁ + 2c₂(x-a) + 3c₃(x-a)² + …

Therefore, at $x=a$ the derivative is

d/dx(∑ₙ₌₀^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = c₁

Therefore, the derivative of the series equals f' (a) if the coefficient c₁ = f' (a).Continuing in this way,we look for coefficients $c_n$ such that all the derivatives of the power series Equation 6.4 will agree with all the corresponding derivatives of $f$ at $x=a$ . The second and third derivatives of Equation 6.4 are given by

d²/dx²(∑ₙ₌₀^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = 2c₂ + 6c₃(x-a) + 12c₄(x-a)² + ...

and

d³/dx³(∑ₙ₌₀^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = 3⋅2c₃ + 4⋅3⋅2c₄(x-a) + 5⋅4⋅3c₅(x-a)² + …

Therefore, at $x=a$ the second and third derivatives

d²/dx²(∑_{n=0}^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = 2c₂

and

d³/dx³(∑ₙ₌₀^∞ cₙ(x-a)ⁿ) = 6c₃

equal f''(a) and f^αₙ(a) respectively, if c₂=f'(a)/2 and c₃=f⁽α⁾(a)/(3⋅2) More generally, we see that if $f$ has a power series representation at $X=a$ ,then thecefients should be given by cₙ=f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n! .That is the series should be

∑ₙ₌₀∞f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!(x-a)ⁿ=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f''(a)/2!(x-a)²+f'''(a)/3!(x-a)³+⋯

This power series for $f$ is known as the Taylor series for $f$ at α. If $a=0$ , then this series is known as the Maclaurin serie for $f$

# Definition

If $f$ has derivatives of all orders at $x=a$ then the Taylor series for the function $f$ at ais

∑_{n=0}^∞ f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!(x-a)ⁿ = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)/2!(x-a)² + ... + f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!(x-a)ⁿ + ...

The Taylor series for $f$ at O is known as the Maclaurin series for $f$

Later in this section, we will show examples of findina Taylor series and discuss conditions under which the Tavlor series for a function will converge to that function. Here, we state an important result. Recall from Uniqueness of Power Series that power series representations are unique. Therefore, if a function $f$ has a power series at a, then it must be the Taylor series for $f$ at $a$

### Theorem 6.6

### Uniqueness of Taylor Series

If a function $f$ has a power series at a that converges to $f$ on some open interval containing a, then that power series is the Taylor series for $f$ at a.

The proof follows directly from Unigueness of Power Series

To determine if a Taylor series converqes, we need to look at its sequence of partial sums. These partial sums are finite polynomials, known as Taylor polynomials.

# Taylor Polynomials

The nth partial sum of the Taylor series for a function $f$ at a is known as the nth Taylor polynomial.For example, the Oth, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd partial sums of the Taylor series are given by

p₀(x) = f(a), p₁(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a), p₂(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)/2!(x-a)², p₃(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)/2!(x-a)² + f'''(a)/3!(x-a)³

respectively. These partial sums are known as the Oth, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Taylor polynomials of $f$ at α,respectively. If $a=0$ ,then these polynomials are known as Maclaurin polynomials for $f.$ We now provide a formal definition of Taylor and Maclaurin polynomials for a function $f$

### Definition

If $f$ has $n$ derivatives at $x=a$ ,then the nth Taylor polynomial for $f$ atais

pₙ(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+(f''(a)/2!)(x-a)²+(f'''(a)/3!)(x-a)³+…+(f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!)(x-a)ⁿ

The nth Taylor polynomial for $f$ at 0 is known as the nth Maclaurin polynomial for $f.$

We now show how to use this definition to find several Taylor polynomials for f(x) = ln x at $x=1$

# EXAMPLE 6.11

### Finding Taylor Polynomials Find the Taylor polynomials $p_{0},p_{1},p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ for f(x) = ln x at $x=1$ Use a graphing utility to compare the graph off $f$

with the graphs of $p_{0},p_{1},p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$

## $②$ Solution

To find these Taylor polynomials, we need to evaluate $f$ and its first three derivatives at $x=1$

1 f(x) = ln x  f(1) = 0
f'(x) = 1/x  f'(1) = 1
f''(x) = -1/x²  f''(1) = -1
f'''(x) = 2/x³  f'''(1) = 2

Therefore,

p₀(x) = f(1) = 0, p₁(x) = f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) = x - 1, p₂(x) = f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) + f''(1)/2(x - 1)² = (x - 1) - 1/2(x - 1)², p₃(x) = f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) + f''(1)/2(x - 1)² + f'''(1)/3!(x - 1)³ = (x - 1) - 1/2(x - 1)² + 1/3(x - 1)³.

### $①$ Solution

a.Since f(x)=eˣ ,we know that f(x)=f'(x)=f''(x)=⋯=f⁽ⁿ⁾(x)=eˣ for all positive integers n.Therefore f(0)=f'(0)=f''(0)=...=f⁽ⁿ⁾(0)=1

for all positive integers n. Therefore, we have

Since the fourth derivative is sin x ,the pattern repeats.That is, f⁽²ᵐ⁾(0) = 0 and $f^{(2m+1)}(0)=(-1)^{m}$ for m≥0 Thus, we have

# Taylor's Theorem with Remainder

Recall that the nth Taylor polynomial for a function $f$ at a is the nth partial sum of the Taylor series for $f$ at a.Therefore to determine if the Taylor series converges, we need to determine whether the sequence of Taylor polynomials {pₙ} converges. However, not only do we want to know if the sequence of Taylor polynomials converges, we want to know if it converges to $f.$ To answer this question, we define the remainder Rₙ(x) as

Rₙ(x) = f(x) - pₙ(x)

For the sequence of Taylor polynomials to converge to $f$ , we need the remainder $R_{n}$ to converge to zero. To determine if. $R_{n}$ converges to zero, we introduce Taylor's theorem with remainder. Not only is this theorem useful in proving that a Taylor series converges to its related function, but it will also allow us to quantify how well the nth Taylor polynomia approximates the function

Here we look for a bound on $|R_n|$ . Consider the simplest case: $n=0$ . Let $P0$ be the Oth Taylor polynomial at a for a function $f.$ The remainder $R_0$ satisfies

R₀(x)=f(x)-p₀(x)=f(x)-f(a).

If $f$ is differentiable on an interval I containing a and $X.$ then by the Mean Value Theorem there exists a real number between a and $x$ such that f(x)-f(a)=f'(c)(x-a) Therefore,

R₀(x)=f'(c)(x-a)

Using the Mean Value Theorem in a similar argument, we can show that if $f$ is $n$ times differentiable on an interval containing a and $x$ then the nth remainder. $R_{n}$ satisfies

Rₙ(x)=f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/(n+1)!(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹

for some real number cbetween a and $X.$ It is important to note that the value L in the numerator above is not the center a, but rather an unknown value $C$ betweena and $X.$ This formula allows us to get a bound on the remainder $R_{n}$ If we happen to know that |f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(x)| is bounded by some real number M on this interval $I_r$ then

|Rₙ(x)|≤M/(n+1)!|x-a|ⁿ⁺¹

for all $X$ in the interval I.

We now state Taylor's theorem, which provides the formal relationship between a function $f$ and its nth degree Taylor polynomial pₙ(x) This theorem allows us to bound the error when using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function value, and will be important in proving that a Taylor series for $f$ converges to $f.$

### Theorem 6.7

### Taylor's Theorem with Remainde

Let $f$ be a function that can be differentiated $n+1$ times on an interval I containing the real number a. Let $p_n$ be the nth Taylor polynomial of $f$ at a and let

Rₙ(x)=f(x)-pₙ(x)

be the nth remainder. Then for each x in the interval I, there exists a real number c between a and $x$ such that

Rₙ(x) = f<sup>(n+1)</sup>(c)/((n+1)!) (x-a)<sup>n+1</sup>

If there exists a real number M such that |f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(x)|≤M for all x ∈ I, then

|Rₙ(x)|≤M/(n+1)!|x-a|ⁿ⁺¹

for all x in I

## Proof

Fix a point x ∈ I and introduce the function $g$ such that

g(t) = f(x) - f(t) - f'(t)(x-t) - f''(t)/2!(x-t)² - ... - f⁽ⁿ⁾(t)/n!(x-t)ⁿ - Rₙ(x)(x-t)ⁿ⁺¹/(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹

We claim that $g$ satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Since. $g$ is a polynomial function (in $t).$ it is a differentiable function. Also, $g$ is zero at $t=a$ and $t=x$ because

g(a) := f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)-f''(a)/2!(x-a)²+…+f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!(x-a)ⁿ-Rₙ(x) = f(x)-pₙ(x)-Rₙ(x) = g(x) = f(x)-f(x)-0-…-0 = 0.

Therefore, $g$ satisfies Rolle's theorem, and consequently, there exists $c$ between a and $x$ such that g'(c)=0 We now calculate g' . Using the product rule, we note that

d/dt[f⁽ⁿ⁾(t)/n!(x-t)ⁿ] = -f⁽ⁿ⁾(t)/(n-1)!(x-t)ⁿ⁻¹ + f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(t)/n!(x-t)ⁿ.

Consequently,

5) g′(t) = -f′(t) + [f′(t)-f″(t)(x-t)] + [f″(t)(x-t) - f″(t)/2!(x-t)²] + ... + [f⁽ⁿ⁾(t)/(n-1)!(x-t)ⁿ⁻¹ - f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(t)/n!(x-t)ⁿ] + (n+1)Rₙ(x)(x-t)ⁿ/(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹

Notice that there is a telescoping effect.Therefore,

 g'(t)=-f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(t)/n!(x-t)ⁿ+(n+1)Rₙ(x)(x-t)ⁿ/(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹ 

By Rolle's theorem,we conclude that there exists a number $C$ between a and $X$ such that g'(c) = 0. Since

g'(c) = -f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/n!(x-c)ⁿ + (n+1)Rₙ(x)(x-c)ⁿ/(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹ 

we conclude that

-f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/n!(x-c)^n+(n+1)Rₙ(x)(x-c)^n/(x-a)^(n+1)=0

Adding the first term on the left-hand side to both sides of the equation and dividing both sides of the equation by (n+1)(x-c)ⁿ/(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹ we coclude that

Rₙ(x)=f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/(n+1)!(x-a)ⁿ⁺¹

as desired. From this fact,it follows that if there exists M such that |f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(x)|≤M for all x in I, then

|Rₙ(x)|≤M/(n+1)!|x-a|ⁿ⁺¹

Not only does Taylor's theorem allow us to prove that a Taylor series converges to a function, but it also allows us to estimate the accuracy of Taylor polynomials in approximating function values. We begin by looking at linear and quadratic approximations of f(x)=∛x at $x=8$ and determine how accurate these approximations are at estimating /.

# EXAMPLE 6.13

### Using Linear and Quadratic Approximations to Estimate Function Values Consider the function f(x)=∛x

a.Find the first and second Taylor polynomials for $f$ at $x=8$ . Use a graphing utility to compare these polynomials with $f$ near $x=8$ b. Use these two polynomials to estimate ∛11 C.Use Taylor's theorem to bound the error.

## $①$ Solution

a.For f(x)=∛x, the values of the function and its first two derivatives at $x=8$ are as followss
f(x) = ³√x  f(8) = 2
f'(x) = 1/(3x^(2/3))  f'(8) = 1/12
f''(x) = -2/(9x^(5/3))  f''(8) = -1/144.

Thus, the first and second Taylor polynomials at $x=8$ are givenby
polynon at x=0 are given by p₁(x) = f(8) + f'(8)(x-8) = 2 + 1/12(x-8) p₂(x) = f(8) + f'(8)(x-8) + f''(8)/2!(x-8)² = 2 + 1/12(x-8) - 1/288(x-8)²

The function and the Taylor polvnomials are shown in Figure 6.9

![](./images/fyAOHOAL3DmgNwAq1b0usVNY2ipLViXmx.png)

Figure 6.9 The graphs of f(x)=∛x and the linear and quadratic approximations p₁(x) and p₂(x)

b.Using the first Taylor polynomial at $x=8$ , we can estimate
∛11≈p₁(11)=2+1/12(11-8)=2.25

Using the second Taylor polynomial at $x=8$ , we obtain
∛11 ≈ p₂(11) = 2 + (11-8)/12 - (11-8)²/288 = 2.21875

C.By Taylor's Theorem with Remainder, there exists a $C$ in the interval (8, 11) such that the remainder when approximating ∛11 by the first Taylor polynomial satisfies
R₁(11)=(f''(c)/2!)(11-8)²

We do not know the exact value of c, so we find an upper bound on $R_{1}$ (11) by determining the maximum value of f'' on the interal 8, 11) Since f''(x)=-2/(9x⁵/³)  , the largest value for |f'(x)| on that interal ocurs at $x=8$ Using the fact that f''(8)=-1/144 , we obtain
|R₁(11)| ≤ 1/(144⋅2!)(11-8)² = 0.03125.

Similarly, to estimate R₂(11) , we use the fact that

R₂(11) = f''(c)/(3!)(11-8)³

Since f''(x) = 10/(27x^(8/3)) , the maximum value of $f^{nv}$ on the interval (8, 11) is fᵟ(8) ≈ 0.0014468 Therefore, we have
|R₂(11)|≤0.0011468/3!(11-8)³≈0.0065104.

6.12 Find the first and second Taylor polynomials for f(x) = √x at $x=4.$ Use these polynomials to estimate 6. Use Taylor's theorem to bound the error

### EXAMPLE 6.14

Approximating sin x Using Maclaurin Polynomials From Example 6.12b., the Maclaurin polynomials for sin x are given by

p₂ₘ₊₁(x) = p₂ₘ₊₂(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + … + (-1)ᵐx²ₘ₊¹/(2m+1)!

for m=0,1,2,…

a.Use the fifth Maclaurin polynomial for sin x to approximate sin (π/18) and bound the error. b.For what values of $x$ does the fifth Maclaurin polynomial approximate sin x to within 0.0001?

## $①$ Solution

a.The fifth Maclaurin polynomial is

p₅(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5!

Using this polynomial, we can estimate as follows
sin(π/18) ≈ p₅(π/18) = π/18 - (π/18)³/3! + (π/18)⁵/5! ≈ 0.173648

To estimate the error, use the fact that the sixth Maclaurin polynomial is p₆(x) = p₅(x) and calculate a bound on R₆(π/18). By Uniqueness of Taylor Series, the remainder is
R₆(π/18) = f⁽⁷⁾(c)/7!(π/18)⁷

for some C between O and π/18. Using the fact that |f⁽⁷⁾(x)| ≤ 1 for all $x_{r}$ we find that the magnitude of the eror is at most
1/7! * (π/18)⁷ ≤ 9.8 x 10⁻¹⁰

b.We need to find the values of $x$ such that


(1/7!)|x|⁷≤0.0001

Solving this inequality for $x$, we have that the fifth Maclaurin polynomial gives an estimate to within 0.oo01 as long as $|x|<0.907$

6.13 Use the fourth Maclaurin polynomial for cosx to approximate cos (π/12)

Now that we are able to bound the remainder Rₙ(x) we can use this bound to prove that a Taylor series for $f$ at converges to $f.$

# Representing Functions with Taylor and Maclaurin Series

We now discuss issues of convergence for Taylor series. We begin by showing how to find a Taylor series for a function and how to find its interval of convergence.

# EXAMPLE 6.15

### Finding a Taylor Series Find the Taylor series for f(x) = 1/x at $x=1$ .Determine the interval of convergence.

## $②$ Solution

For f(x) = 1/x ,the values of the function and its first four derivatives at $x=1$ are



lim_(n→∞) Rₙ(x) = 0.

We now state this theorem formally

### Theorem 6.8

### Convergence of Taylor Series

Suppose that $f$ has derivatives of all orders on an interval I containing a. Then the Taylor series

∑ₙ₌₀^∞ f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n!(x-a)ⁿ

converges to f(x) for all xin Iif and only if

lim<sub>n→∞</sub>Rₙ(x)=0

for all xin I

With this theorem, we can prove that a Taylor series for $f$ at a converges to $f$ if we can prove that the remainder Rₙ(x)→0 To prove that Rₙ(x)→0 ,we typically use the bound

|Rₙ(x)|≤M/(n+1)!|x-a|ⁿ⁺¹

from Taylor's theorem with remainder

In the next example, we find the Maclaurin series for $e^x$ and sinx and show that these series converqe to the corresponding functions for all real numbers by proving that the remainders Rₙ(x)→0 for all real numbers x.

# EXAMPLE 6.16

### Finding Maclaurin Series

For each of the following functions, find the Maclaurin series and its interval of convergence. Use Taylor's Theorem with Remainder to prove that the Maclaurin series for $f$ converges to $f$ on that interval.

a. $e^x$ b.sinx

# $②$ Solution a.Using the nth Maclaurin polynomial for $e^x$ found in Example 6.12a.,wefind that theMaclaurin series for $e^x$ is given

by

∑_(n=0)^∞ xⁿ/n!

To determine the interval of convergence, we use the ratio test. Since
|aₙ₊₁|/|aₙ|=|x|/(n+1)

we have

lim_(n→∞)|aₙ₊₁|/|aₙ|=lim_(n→∞)|x|/(n+1)=0

for all $x.$ Therefore, the series converges absolutely for al xμ and thus, the interval of convergence is , .T

show that the series converges to $e^x$ for all x, we use the fact that f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) = eˣ for all n≥0 and $e^x$ is an increasing function on(—∞o, ∞). Therefore, for any real number $b$ themaximum value of $e^x$ for all |x|≤b is $e^{b}.$ Thus

|Rₙ(x)|≤eᵇ/(n+1)!|x|ⁿ⁺¹

Since we just showed that

∑_(n=0)^∞ |x|ⁿ/n!

converges for all $x$, by the divergence test, we know that

lim_{n→∞}|x|ⁿ⁺¹/((n+1)!) = 0

for any real number $x.$ By combining this fact with the squeeze theorem, the result is lim Rₙ(x) = 0

lim (n→∞) Rₙ(x) = 0.

b.Usinq the nth Maclaurin polynomial for sinx found in Example 6.12b.,we find that the Maclaurin series for sin $x$ is given by

∑_(n=0)^∞(-1)^n(x^(2n+1))/((2n+1)!)

In order to apply the ratio test, consider
|a_{n+1}|/|aₙ| = |x|²/(2n+3)(2n+2)

Since

lim (n→∞) |x|²/(2n+3)(2n+2)=0

for all $X.$ we obtain the interval of convergence as(-oo,o. To show that the Maclaurin series converges to sin x look at Rₙ(x) For each $x$ there exists a real number $c$ between 0 and $x$ such that
Rₙ(x)=f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/(n+1)!xⁿ⁺¹

Since |f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)|≤1 for all integers $n$ and all real numbers $C_{r}$ we have
|Rₙ(x)|≤|x|ⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)!

for all real numbers x. Using the same idea as in part a., the result is lim  Rₙ(x)=0  for all $x$, and therefore, the →00

Maclaurin series for sin.x converges to sin x for all real x

### STUDENT PROJECT

Proving that e is Irrational In this project, we use the Maclaurin polynomials for $e^x$ to prove that e is irrational. The proof relies on supposing that e is rational and arriving at a contradiction. Therefore, in the following steps, we suppose $e=r/s$ for some integers rand swhere s≠0 1.Write the Maclaurin polynomials p₀(x),p₁(x),p₂(x),p₃(x),p₄(x) for e*.Evaluate p₀(1),p₁(1),p₂(1),p₃(1),p₄(1) to estimate e 2.Let Rₙ(x) denote the remainder when using pₙ(x) to estimate $e^{x}.$ .Therefore,  Rₙ(x)=eˣ-pₙ(x) , and Rₙ(1)=e-pₙ(1). Assuming that 
e = r/s for integers r and $S_r$ evaluate R₀(1),R₁(1),R₂(1),R₃(1),R₄(1) 3.Using the results from part 2, show that for each remainder R₀(1), R₁(1), R₂(1), R₃(1), R₄(1), we can find an integer k such that kRₙ(1) is an integer for $n=0,1,2,3,4$ 4.Write down the formula for the nth Maclaurin polynomial pₙ(x) for $e^x$ and the corresponding remainder Rₙ(x) Show that $sn!R_n(1)$ is an integer 5.Use Taylor's theorem to write down an explicit formula for Rₙ(1) .Conclude that Rₙ(1) ≠ 0 ,and therefore sn!Rₙ(1)≠0 6.Use Taylor's theorem to find an estimate on Rₙ(1) Use this estimate combined with the result from part 5 to show that |sn!Rₙ(1)|<se/(n+1) Conclude that if n is large enough, then $|sn!R_n(1)|<1.$ Therefore,e $sn!R_n$ (1) is an integer with magnitude less than 1. Thus, sn!Rₙ(1)=0 .But from part 5, we know that sn!Rη(1)≠0 Wehave arrived at a contradiction, and consequently, the original supposition that e is rational must be false.

# The Binomial Series

Our first goal in this section is to determine the Maclaurin series for the function f(x)=(1+x)' for all real numbers r The Maclaurin series for this function is known as the binomial series.We begin by considering the simplest case: $r$ is a nonnegative integer. We recall that, for r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, f(x) = (1 + x)' can be written as

f(x) = (1+x)⁰ = 1, f(x) = (1+x)¹ = 1+x, f(x) = (1+x)² = 1+2x+x², f(x) = (1+x)³ = 1+3x+3x²+x³, f(x) = (1+x)⁴ = 1+4x+6x²+4x³+x⁴

The expressions on the riaht-hand side are known as binomial expansions and the coefficients are known as binomia coefficients. More generally,for any nonnegative integer r, the binomial coefficient of x′ʳ in the binomial expansion of (1+x)' is given by

rCn=r!/(n!(r-n)!)

and

f(x) = (1+x)ʳ = (r 0)1 + (r 1)x + (r 2)x² + (r 3)x³ + ... + (r r-1)xʳ⁻¹ + (r r)xʳ = Σⁿ₌₀ʳ (r n)xⁿ.

For example, using this formula for $r=5$ ,we see that
f(x) = (1+x)⁵ = ⁵C₀ + ⁵C₁x + ⁵C₂x² + ⁵C₃x³ + ⁵C₄x⁴ + ⁵C₅x⁵ = 1+5x+10x²+10x³+5x⁴+x⁵

We now consider the case when the exponent $r$ is any real number, not necessarily a nonnegative integer. If $r$ is not a nonnegative integer, then $f(x)=(1+x)^{r}$ cannot be written as a finite polynomial. However, we can find a power series for $f$ . Specifically, we look for the Maclaurin series for $f$ . To do this, we find the derivatives of $f$ and evaluate them at $x=0$

f(x) = (1+x)ʳ, f(0) = 1; f'(x) = r(1+x)ʳ⁻¹, f'(0) = r; f''(x) = r(r-1)(1+x)ʳ⁻², f''(0) = r(r-1); f'''(x) = r(r-1)(r-2)(1+x)ʳ⁻³, f'''(0) = r(r-1)(r-2); f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) = r(r-1)(r-2)...(r-n+1)(1+x)ʳ⁻ⁿ, f⁽ⁿ⁾(0) = r(r-1)(r-2)...(r-n+1)

We conclude that the coefficients in the binomial series are given by

f<sup>(n)</sup>(0)/n! = r(r-1)(r-2)...(r-n+1)/n!

We note that if $r$ is a nonnegative integer, then the $(r+1)$ st derivative $f^{(r+1)}$ is the zero function, and the series terminates. In addition, if $r$ is a nonnegative integer then Equation 6.8 for the coefficients agrees with Equation 6.6 for the coefficients, and the formula for the binomial series agrees with Equation 6.7 for the finite binomial expansion. More generally, to denote the binomial coefficients for any real number r, we define

(ⁿᵣ)=r(r−1)(r−2)⋯(r−n+1)/n!

With this notation, we can write the binomial series for $(1+x)^{r}$ as

∑<sub>n=0</sub><sup>∞</sup>(<sup>r</sup><sub>n</sub>)x<sup>n</sup> = 1 + rx + r(r-1)/2!x² + ... + r(r-1)...(r-n+1)/n!x<sup>n</sup> + ...

We now need to determine the interval of convergence for the binomial series Equation 6.9. We apply the ratio test Consequently, we consider

|aₙ₊₁|/|aₙ| = |r(r-1)(r-2)...(r-n)xⁿ⁺¹|/((n+1)!) * n!/|r(r-1)(r-2)...(r-n+1)xⁿ| = |r-n||x|/(n+1).

Since

limₙ→∞|aₙ₊₁|/|aₙ|=|x|<1

if and only if $|x|<1$ , we conclude that the interval of convergence for the binomial series is (-1,1). The behavior at the endpoints depends onr.It can be shown that for r≥0 the series converges at both endpoints; for $-1<r<0$ ,the series converges at $x=1$ and diverges at $x=-1$ ; and for $r<-1$ , the series diverges at both endpoints. The binomia series does converge to $(1+x)^{r}$ in (-1,1) for all real numbers $F$ , but proving this fact by showing that the remainder Rη(x) → 0 is difficult

### Definition

For any real number r, the Maclaurin series for f(x)=(1+x)' is the binomial series.It converges to $f$ for $|x|<1$ and we write

(1+x)ʳ = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (r n)xⁿ = 1 + rx + r(r-1)/2!x² + ... + r(r-1)...(r-n+1)/n!xⁿ + ...

for $|x|<1$

We can use this definition to find the binomial series for f(x) = √(1+x²) and use the series to approximate √1.5

# EXAMPLE 6.17

### Finding Binomial Series

a.Find the binomial series for f(x)=√(1+x) b. Use the third-order Maclaurin polynomial p₃(x) to estimate √1.5 .Use Taylor's theorem to bound the error. Use a

graphing utility to compare the graphs of $f$ and $p_3$

## O Solution

a.Here r=1/2 . Using the definition for the binomial series, we obtain
9 trie demiluon lior the billoillial serles, we oblalli √(1+x) = 1+(1/2)x+((1/2)(-1/2))/2!x² +((1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2))/3!x³+⋯ = 1+(1/2)x-(1/2!) (1/2²)x²+(1/3!)(1⋅3/2³)x³-⋯+(-1)^(n+1)/n!(1⋅3⋅5⋯(2n-3)/2ⁿ)xⁿ+⋯ = 1+∑_(n=1)^∞((-1)^(n+1)/n!)(1⋅3⋅5⋯(2n-3)/2ⁿ)xⁿ.

b.From the result in part a. the third-order Maclaurin polynomialis
p₃(x) = 1 + (1/2)x - (1/8)x² + (1/16)x³

Therefore,

√1.5 = √(1+0.5) ≈ 1 + 1/2(0.5) - 1/8(0.5)² + 1/16(0.5)³ ≈ 1.2266

From Taylor's theorem, the error satisfies

R₃(0.5)=(f⁽⁴⁾(c)/4!)(0.5)⁴

for some c between 0 and 0.5. Since f⁽⁴⁾(x) = -15/(2⁴(1+x)⁷/²) , and the maximum value of |f⁽⁴⁾(x)| on the interva (0, 0.5) occurs at $x=0$ , we have
|R₃(0.5)| ≤ 15/(4!2⁴)(0.5)⁴ ≈ 0.00244

The function and the Maclaurin polynomial $p_3$ are graphed in Figure 6.10

6.16 Find the bnomial series for f(x)=1/(1+x)²

## Common Functions Expressed as Taylor Series.

At this point, we have derived Maclaurin series for exponential, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions, as well as functions of the form f(x)=(1+x)' . In Table 6.1, we summarize the results of these series. We remark that the convergence of the Maclaurin seriesfor f(x)=ln(1+x) at the endpoint $x=1$ and the Maclaurin series for f(x)=tan⁻¹x at the endpoints $x=1$ and $x=-1$ relies on a more advanced theorem than we present here.(Refer to Abel's theorem for a discussion of this more technical point.)

Table 6.1 Maclaurin Series for Common Functions

Earlier in the chapter, we showed how you could combine power series to create new power series. Here we use these properties, combined with the Maclaurin series in Table 6.1, to create Maclaurin series for other functions

### EXAMPLE 6.18

### Deriving Maclaurin Series from Known Series

Find the Maclaurin series of each of the following functions by using one of the series listed in Table 6.1

a. f(x)=cos√x b. f(x) = sinh x

## $①$ Solution

a.Using the Maclaurin series for cos x we find that the Maclaurin series for cos√x is given by
∑ₙ₌₀∞((-1)ⁿ(√x)²ⁿ/(2n)!)=∑ₙ₌₀((-1)ⁿxⁿ/(2n)!)=1-x/2!+x²/4!-x³/6!+x⁴/8!-…

This series converges to cos√x for all X in thedomain of cos √x that is,for all x≥0

b.To find the Maclaurin series for sinh.x, we use the fact that
sinh x = (eˣ - e⁻ˣ)/2

Using the Maclaurin series for $e^{X}$ , we see that the nth term in the Maclaurin series for sinh x is given by xⁿ/n! - (-x)ⁿ/n!

For n even,this term is zero. For n odd, this term is 2xⁿ/n! .Therefore, the Maclaurin series for sinh x has only odd

order terms and is given by

Σₙ₌₀∞ x²ⁿ⁺¹/(2n+1)! = x + x³/3! + x⁵/5! + …

![](./images/f8pqx98owWt7VKGNonroBwKp9RrZCHp51.png)

6.17 Find the Maclaurin series for sin(x²)

We also showed previously in this chapter how power series can be differentiated term by term to create a new power series. In Example 6.19, we differentiate the binomial series for √(1+x) term by term to find the binomial series for 1/√(1+x) Note that we could construt the binomial seriesfor 1/√(1+x) directly from the definition, but differentiating the binomial series for √(1+x) is an easier calculation

### EXAMPLE 6.19

### Differentiating a Series to Find a New Series Use the binomial seies for √(1+x) to find the binomial series for 1/√(1+x)

![](./images/fFnY3ApnGc1dA2v3yvSHqZULl2bZCE2Xg.png)

### The two functions are related by

d/dx√(1+x) = 1/(2√(1+x)),

so the binomial series for 1/√(1+x) is given by

1/(√(1+x)) = 2d(√(1+x))/dx = 1 + Σ_(n=1)^∞ ((-1)^n/n!) * (1*3*5*…*(2n-1)/2^n) * x^n 

6.18 Fin the binomial series for f(x) = 1/(1+x)^(3/2)

In this example, we differentiated a known Taylor series to construct a Taylor series for another function. The ability to differentiate power series term by term makes them a powerful tool for solving differential equations. We now show how this is accomplished.

### Solving Differential Equations with Power Series

Consider the differential equation


y'(x) = y

Recall that this is a first-order separable equation and its solution is $y=Ce^{x}$ . This equation is easily solved using techniques discussed earlierin the text.For most differential equations,however, we do not yet have analytical tools to solve them. Power series are an extremely useful tool for solving many types of differential equations. In this technique, we lo fora soutiono the formn y = Σₙ₌₀cₙxⁿ and dtermine whathecefients would ne to e Inthe nert example, we consider an initial-value problem involving y' = y to illustrate the technique.

# EXAMPLE 6.20

### Power Series Solution of a Differential Equation

Use power series to solve the initial-value problem

y'=y, y(0)=3

## $②$ Solution

Suppose that there exists a power series solution

y(x) = Σ_(n=0)^∞ cₙxⁿ = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + c₃x³ + c₄x⁴ + ...

Differentiating this series term by term,we obtain

y'=c₁+2c₂x+3c₃x²+4c₄x³+…

If ysatisfies the differential equation, ther.


c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + c₃x³ + … = c₁ + 2c₂x + 3c₃x² + 4c₃x³ + …

Using Uniqueness of Power Series on the uniqueness of power series representations, we know that these series can only be equal if their coefficients are equal. Therefore,

co = c₁, c₁ = 2c₂, c₂ = 3c₃, c₃ = 4c₄, …

Using the initial condition $y(0)=3$ combined with the power series representation

y(x) = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + c₃x³ + ...

we find that $c_0=3$ We are nowready to solve for the rest of the coefficients.Using the fact that $c_{0}=3$ , we have

 c = c₀ = 3 = 3/1!, c₂ = c₁/2 = 3/2 = 3/2!, c₃ = c₂/3 = 3/(3⋅2) = 3/3!, c₄ = c₃/4 = 3/(4⋅3⋅2) = 3/4! 

y=3[1+x+x²/2!+x³/3!+x⁴/4!+⋯]=3∑ₙ₌₀^∞ xⁿ/n!

Therefore,

You might recognize

∑<sub>n=0</sub><sup>∞</sup>xⁿ/n!

as the Taylor series for $e^{X}$ . Therefore, the solution is $y=3e^{x}$

We now consider an example involving a differential equation that we cannot solve using previously discussed methods. This differential equation

$$y'-xy=0$$

is known as Airy's equation. It has many applications in mathematical physics, such as modeling the diffraction of light Here we show how to solve it using power series.

# EXAMPLE 6.21

Power Series Solution of Airy's Equation

Use power series to solve

y'' - xy = 0

with the initial conditions $y(0)=a$ and y'(0) = b

We look for a solution of the form

y=∑ₙ₌₀^∞cₙxⁿ=c₀+c₁x+c₂x²+c₃x³+c₄x⁴+…

Differentiating this function term by term, we obtain

y′=c₁+2c₂x+3c₃x²+4c₄x³+…, y″=2⋅1c₂+3⋅2c₃x+4⋅3c₄x²+…

If y satisfies the equation y''=xy then

2⋅1c₂ + 3⋅2c₃x + 4⋅3c₄x² + ... = x(c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + c₃x³ + ...)

Using Uniqueness of Power Series on the uniqueness of power series representations, we know that coefficients of the same deqree must be equal. Therefore

2⋅1c₂ = 0, 3⋅2c₃ = c₀, 4⋅3c₄ = c₁, 5⋅4c₅ = c₂, …

More generally, for n≥3 , we have n(n-1)cₙ = cₙ₋₃ In fact, all coefficients can be written in terms of $c_0$ and $c_1$ .To see this, first note that $c_{2}=0$ . Then

c₃=c₀/(3·2), c₄=c₁/(4·3)

For $c_{5},c_{6},c_{7}$ , we see that

c₅=c₂/(5⋅4)=0, c₆=c₃/(6⋅5)=c₀/(6⋅5⋅3⋅2), c₇=c₄/(7⋅6)=c₁/(7⋅6⋅4⋅3)

Therefore, the series solution of the differential equation is given by

y=c₀+c₁x+0⋅x²+c₀/(3⋅2)x³+c₁/(4⋅3)x⁴+0⋅x⁵+c₀/(6⋅5⋅3⋅2)x⁶+c₁/(7⋅6⋅4⋅3)x⁷+⋯

The initial condition $y(0)=a$ implies $c_0=a$ . Differentiating this series term by term and using the fact that y'(0) = b we conclude that cₗ = b . Therefore, the solution of this initial-value problem is

y = a(1 + x³/6 + x⁶/180 + …) + b(x + x⁴/12 + x⁷/504 + …)

6.20 Use power series to solve y''+x²y=0 with the initial condition $y(0)=a$ and y' $( 0) = b.$

### Evaluating Nonelementary Integrals

Solving differential equations is one common application of power series. We now turn to a second application. We show how power series can be used to evaluate integrals involving functions whose antiderivatives cannot be expressed using elementary functions

One integral tat rises iten n apiationsin robabiy t eor ir ∫e⁻ˣ²dx Unfotntly th antideriativ of tht integrand $e^{-x^2}$ is not an elementary function.By elementary function, we mean a function that can be writen using a finite number of algebraic combinations or compositions of exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or power functions. We remark that the term“elementary function" is not synonymous with noncomplicated function.For example, the function f(x)=√(x²-3x)+eˣ³-sin(5x+4) is an elementary function, although not a particularly simple-looking function. An integrl of the form ∫f(x)dx where the antiderivative of $f$ cannot be writen as an elementary function is considered a nonelementary integral

Nonelementary integrals cannot be evaluated using the basic integration techniques discussed earlier. One way to evaluate such integrals is by expressing the integrand as a power series and integrating term by term. We demonstrate this tecnique by cnsidering ∫e⁻ˣ²dx

# EXAMPLE 6.22

### Using Taylor Series to Evaluate a Definite Integral

a. Expres ∫e⁻ˣ²dx as n infint series b. Ealate ∫₀¹e⁻ˣ²dx to wthnaneror f.

## $②$ Solution a. The Maclaurin series for $e^{-x^2}$ is given by

e⁻ˣ² = Σₙ₌₀^∞((-x²)ⁿ/n!) = 1-x²+x⁴/2!-x⁶/3!+⋯+(-1)ⁿx²ⁿ/n!+⋯ = Σₙ₌₀(-1)ⁿx²ⁿ/n!

Therefore,

∫e^(-x²)dx = ∫(1-x²+(x⁴/2!)-(x⁶/3!)+⋯+(-1)^n(x²ⁿ/n!)+⋯)dx = C+x-(x³/3)+(x⁵/(5·2!))-(x⁷/(7·3!))+⋯+(-1)^n(x²ⁿ⁺¹/((2n+1)n!))+⋯

b.Using the result from part a.we have

∫₀¹e⁻ˣ²dx=1-1/3+1/10-1/42+1/216-…

The sum of the first four terms is approximately 0.74. By the alternating series test, this estimate is accurate tc within an error of less than 1/216 ≈ 0.0046296 < 0.01

Expres cos d s nininie eries saluaae ∫_0^1cos√xdx to within nerorofo.o

As mentioned above, th integral ∫e⁻ˣ²dx ari naiy t y i i in at sets that are normally distributed, meaning the data values lie under a bell-shaped curve. For example, if a set of data values is normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ , then the probability that a randomly chosen value lies between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is given by

1/(σ√(2π))∫ₐᵇ e⁻⁽ˣ⁻μ⁾²/⁽²σ²⁾ dx

### (See Fiqure 6.11.)

![](./images/f2LxzEuG1kAX96EWkTPPw8O34TAx6unRf.png)

Figure 6.11 If data values are normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ theprobability that a randomly eleced dat valeis eavee $a$ and $b$ is th araunderthecurve y=(1/(σ√(2π)))e^-(x-μ)²/(2σ²) between $x=a$ and $x=b$

To simplify this integral, we typically let z = (x - μ)/σ This quantity $Z$ is known as the $z$ score of a data value. With this simplification,inteqral Equation 6.10becomes

(1/√(2π))∫(a-μ)/σ^(b-μ)/σe^(-z²/2)dz

In Example 6.23, we show how we can use this inteqral in calculatinq probabilities

## EXAMPLE 6.23

### Using Maclaurin Series to Approximate a Probability

Suppose a set of standardized test scores are normally distributed with mean μ=100 and standard deviation σ=50 Use Equation 6.11 and the first six terms in the Maclaurin series for $e^{-x^2/2}$ to approximate the probability that a randomly selected test score is between $x=100$ and $x=200$ . Use the alternating series test to determine how accurate your approximation is.

![](./images/f3l7ipkmyL0VuGUm4Ss89m8etdKz5Sbtg.png)

### Solution

Since μ=100 σ=50 ,and we are trying to determine the area under the curve from $a=100$ to $b=200$ , integra Equation 6.11 becomes

(1/√(2π))∫₀²e⁻ᶻ²/²dz.

The Maclaurin series for $e^{-x^2/2}$ is given by

e⁻ˣ²/²=∑ₙ₌₀^∞(-x²/2)^n/n!=1-x²/2¹⋅1!+x⁴/2²⋅2!-x⁶/2³⋅3!+⋯+(-1)^nx²ⁿ/2ⁿ⋅n!+⋯=∑ₙ₌₀(-1)^nx²ⁿ/2ⁿ⋅n!

Therefore,

(1/√(2π))∫e^(-z²/2)dz = (1/√(2π))∫(1 - z²/2 - z⁴/8 + z⁶/48 + … + (-1)ⁿz²ⁿ/(2ⁿn!) + …)dz = (1/√(2π))(C + z - z³/6 + z⁵/40 - z⁷/336 + … + (-1)ⁿz²ⁿ⁺¹/((2n+1)2ⁿn!) + …)(1/√(2π))∫₀²e^(-z²/2)dz = (1/√(2π))(2 - 8/6 + 32/40 - 128/336 + 512/3456 - 2¹¹/(11⋅2⁵⋅5!) + …)

Using the first five terms, we estimate that the probability is approximately 0.4922.By the alternating series test, we see that this estimate is accurate to within

1/√(2π) * 2¹³/13*2⁶*6! ≈ 0.00546

### ® Analysis

If you are familiar with probability theory, you may know that the probability that a data value is within two standard deviations of the mean is approximately 95% . Here we calculated the probability that a data value is between the mean and two standard deviations above the mean, so the estimate should be around 47.5% .The estimate,combined with the bound on the accuracy, falls within this range.

Use the first five terms of the Maclaurin series for $e^{-x^2/2}$ to estimate the probability that a randomly 6.22 selected test score is between 100 and 150. Use the alternating series test to determine the accuracy of this estimate.

Another application in which a nonelementary integral arises involves the period of a pendulum. The integral is

∫₀^(π/2)dθ/√(1-k²sin²θ)

An inteqral of this form is known as an elliptic inteqral of the first kind. Elliptic inteqrals oriqinally arose when trying to calculate the arc length of an ellipse. We now show how to use power series to approximate this integral

### EXAMPLE 6.24

### Period of a Pendulum

The period of a pendulum is the time it takes for a pendulum to make one complete back-and-forth swing. For a pendulum with length $L$ that makes a maximum angle  θₘₐₓ with the vertical, its period $T$ is given by

T = 4√(L/g)∫₀^π/₂ dθ/√(1 - k²sin²θ)

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and k=sin(θₘₐₓ/2) (see Figure 6.12). (We note that this formula for the period arises from a non-linearized model of a pendulum. In some cases, for simplification, a linearized model is used and sinθ is approximated by θ ) Use the binomial series

1/√(1+x)=1+∑_(n=1)^∞((-1)ⁿ/(n!))(1·3·5···(2n-1)/2ⁿ)xⁿ

to estimate the period of this pendulum. Specifically, approximate the period of the pendulum if

a.you use only the first term in the binomial series, and b.you use the first two terms in the binomial series.

![](./images/fn2gO2Gekho2kaI8d180N88caomID0IYH.png)

position

Figure 6.12 This pendulum has length $L$ and makes a maximum angle  θₘₐₓ with the vertical.

### $②$ Solution We use the binomial series, replacing $x$ with -k²sin²θ Then we can write the period as

T = 4√(L/g)∫₀^π/₂ (1 + 1/2k²sin²θ + (1·3)/(2!2²)k⁴sin⁴θ + ...)dθ

a.Using just the first term in the integrand, the first-order estimate is
T ≈ 4√(L/g)∫₀^(π/2) dθ = 2π√(L/g).

If θₘₐₓ is small,then k = sin (max is small. We claim that when $k$ is small, this is a good estimate. To justify this claim, consider
∫₀^(π/2)(1 + (1/2)k²sin²θ + (1⋅3/(2!2²))k⁴sin⁴θ + …)dθ

Since |sin x|≤1 , this integral is bounded by
∫₀^π/₂(½k²+1.3/(2!2²)k⁴+⋯)dθ<π/₂(½k²+1⋅3/(2!2²)k⁴+⋯)

Furthermore, it can be shown that each coefficient on the right-hand side is less than 1 and, therefore, that this expression is bounded by

(πk²/2)(1+k²+k⁴+…)=(πk²/2)/(1-k²)

which is small for $k$ small. b.For larger values of  θₘₐₓ ,we can approximate T by using more terms in the integrand. By using the first two terms

in the inteqral,we arrive at the estimate
T ≈ 4√(L/g)∫_0^(π/2)(1 + (1/2)k²sin²θ)dθ = 2π√(L/g)(1 + k²/4)

The applications of Taylor series in this section are intended to highlight their importance. In general, Taylor series are useful because they allow us to represent known functions using polynomials, thus providing us a tool for approximating function values and estimating complicated integrals. In addition, they allow us to define new functions as power series, thus providing us with a powerful tool for solving differential equations.

·For a power series centered at $x=a$ ,one of the following three properties hold: i.The power series converges only at $x=a$ In this case, we say that the radius of convergence is $R=0$ i.The power series converges for all real numbers $x.$ In this case, we say that the radius of convergence is R=∞ ilii.There is a real number $R$ such that the series convergesfor $|x-a|<R$ and diverges for $|x-a|>R$ .In this case, the radius of convergence is $R.$ ·If a power series converges on a finite interval, the series may or may not converge at the endpoints :The ratio test may often be used to determine the radius of convergence · The geometric series x" = for $|x|<1$ allows us to represent certain functions using geometri series.

## Introduction

The chambered nautilus is a fascinating creature. This animal feeds on hermit crabs, fish, and other crustaceans. It has a hard outer shell with many chambers connected in a spiral fashion, and it can retract into its shell to avoid predators When part of the shell is cut away, a perfect spiral is revealed, with chambers inside that are somewhat similar to growth

## rings in a tree.

The mathematical function that describes a spiral can be expressed using rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinates However, if we change our coordinate system to something that works a bit better with circular patterns, the function becomes much simpler to describe. The polar coordinate system is well suited for describing curves of this type. How can we use this coordinate system to describe spirals and other radial figures? (See Example Z.14.)

In this chapter we also study parametric equations, which give us a convenient way to describe curves, or to study the position of a particle or object in two dimensions as a function of time. We will use parametric equations and polar coordinates for describing many topics later in this text

# 7.1 Parametric Equations

### Learning Objectives

7.1.1 Plot a curve described by parametric equations 7.1.2 Convert the parametric equations of a curve into the form $y=f(x)$ 7.1.3 Recognize the parametric equations of basic curves, such as a line and a circle. 7.1.4 Recognize the parametric equations of a cycloid

In this section we examine parametric equations and their graphs. In the two-dimensional coordinate system parametric equations are useful for describing curves that are not necessarily functions. The parameter is an independent variable that both x and y depend on, and as the parameter increases, the values of $x$ and ytrace out a path along a plane curve. For example, if the parameter is t(a common choice), then t might represent time. Then x and y are defined as functions of time, and (x(t), y(t)) can describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a curved path.

# Parametric Equations and Their Graphs

Consider the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Our year lasts approximately 365.25 days, but for this discussion we will use 365 days. On January 1 of each year, the physical location of Earth with respect to the Sun is nearly the same, except for leap years, when the lag introduced by the extra 1/4 day of orbiting time is built into the calendar. We call January 1 "day 1" of the year. Then, for example, day 31 is January 31, day 59 is February 28, and so on.

The number of the day in a year can be considered a variable that determines Earth's position in its orbit. As Earth revolves around the Sun, its physical location changes relative to the Sun. After one full year, we are back where we started, and a new year begins. According to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the shape of the orbit is elliptical, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. We study this idea in more detail in Conic Sections

![](./images/fH822vQKmhwsGlBRi2QtccAx8rEDxa6Me.png)
Figure 7.2 Earth's orbit around the Sun in one year

Figure 7.2 depicts Earth's orbit around the Sun during one year. The point labeled $F_{2}$ is one of the foci of the ellipse; the other focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs to each point on the ellipse (Figure 7.3). Then each xvalue on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and each yvalue is also a value of position as a function of time.Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value of Earth's position as a function of time.

![](./images/fQZGzbeGW51oNNf8CUaGY9BOGIakRUpuF.png)
Figure 7.3 Coordinate axes superimposed on the orbit of Earth.

We can determine the functions for x(t) and $y(t)$ ,thereby parameterizing the orbit of Earth around the Sun.The variable $t$ is called an independent parameter and, in this context, represents time relative to the beginning of each year

A curve in the $(x,y)$ plane can be represented parametrically. The equations that are used to define the curve are called parametric equations

### Definition

If x and y are continuous functions of ton an interval Iμ then the equations

x=x(t) and y=y(t)

are called parametric equations and tis called the parameter. The set of points $(x,y)$ obtained as t varies over the interval Iis called the graph of the parametric equations. The graph of parametric equations is called a parametric curve or plane curve, and is denoted by $C.$

Notice in this definition that $x$ and y are used in two ways. The first is as functions of the independent variable t. As varies over the interval $I$, the functions x(t) and $y(t)$ generate a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ . This set of ordered pairs generates the graph of the parametric equations. In this second usage, to designate the ordered pairs, x and yare variables. It is important to distinguish the variables x and y from the functions x(t) and $y(t)$

## EXAMPLE 7.1

### Graphing a Parametrically Defined Curve

Sketch the curves described by the following parametric equations:

8 x(t) = t² - 3 x(t)=t-1, y(t)=2t+4, -3≤t≤2; x(t)=t²-3, y(t)=2t+1, -2≤t≤3; x(t)=4cos t, y(t)=4sin t, 0≤t≤2π

## のSolution

a.To create a graph of this curve, first set up a table of values. Since the independent variable in both x(t) and $y(t)$ is t, let t appear in the first column. Then x(t) and $y(t)$ will appear in the second and third columns of the table


t|x(t)|y(t)
-3|-4|-2
-2|-3|0
-1|-2|2
0|-1|4
1|0|6
2| |8


The second and third columns in this table provide a set of points to be plotted. The graph of these points appears in Eigure Z.4.The arrows on the graph indicate the orientation of the graph, that is, the direction that a point moves on the graph as t varies from -3 to 2.

The second and third columns in this table give a set of points to be plotted (Figure 7.5). The first point on the graph (corresponding to $t=-2$ ) has coordinates (1,-3) ,and the last point (corresponding to $t=3$ ) has coordinates (6,7) . As t progresses from -2 to 3, the point on the curve travels along a parabola. The direction the point moves is again called the orientation and is indicated on the graph.

The graph of this plane curve appears in the following graph

Figure 7.6 Graph of the plane curve described by the parametric equations in part c

This is the graph of a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin, with a counterclockwise orientation. The starting point and ending points of the curve both have coordinates (4,0)

7.1 Sketch the curve described by the parametric equations
x(t) = 3t + 2, y(t) = t² - 1, -3 ≤ t ≤ 2

### Eliminating the Parameter

Tobetterunderstand the graph of a curve representedparametrically,it isuseful torewrite the two equations as a single equation relating the variables $x$ and $y.$ Then we can apply any previous knowledge of equations of curves in the plane to identify the curve. For example, the equations describing the plane curve in Example 7.1b. are

x(t)=t²-3, y(t)=2t+1, -2≤t≤3

Solving the second equation for $t$ gives

t=(y-1)/2

This can be substituted into the first equation

x = ((y-1)/2)² - 3 = (y²-2y-11)/4

This equation describes $x$ as a function of $y.$ These steps give an example of eliminating the parameter. The graph of this function is a parabola opening to the right. Recall that the plane curve started at (1,-3) and ended at (6,7) .These terminations were due to the restriction on the parameter t.

### EXAMPLE 7.2

## Eliminating the Parameter

Eliminate the parameter for each of the plane curves described by the following parametric equations and describe the resulting graph.

a. X(=2+4 x(t) = √(2t+4) x(t)=√(2t+4), y(t)=2t+1, -2≤t≤6; x(t)=4cos t, y(t)=3sin t, 0≤t≤2π

### $②$ Solution

To eliminate the parameter, we can solve either of the equations for t. For example, solving the first equation for t gives
x = √(2t+4); x² = 2t+4; x²-4 = 2t; t = (x²-4)/2.

Note that when we square both sides it is important to observe that x ≥ 0 Substituting t =²=4 this into $y(t)$ yields

y(t)=2t+1, y=2((x²-4)/2)+1, y=x²-4+1, y=x²-3

This is the equation of a parabola opening upward. There is, however, a domain restriction because of the limits on the parameter t. When $t=-2$ x=√(2(-2)+4)=0 , and when $t=6$ x=√(2(6)+4)=4 The graphof thisplane curve follows.

![](./images/faNNzHQ8hkYHk073SitZpIZqpiyGtuAVD.png)

Figure 7.7 Graph of the plane curve described by theparametric equations in part a

b.Sometimes it is necessary to be a bit creative in eliminating the parameter. The parametric equations for this example are
x(t)=4cost and y(t)=3sint

Solving either equation for t directly is not advisable because sine and cosine are not one-to-one functions. However, dividing the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 (and suppressing the $t)$ gives us cos 
t = x/4 and sint =y

Now use the Pythagorean identity cos²t + sin²t = 1 and replace the expressions for sint and cos t with the equivalent expressions in terms of $x$ and y.This qives
(x/4)²+(y/3)²=1

This is the equation of a horizontal ellipse centered at the origin, with semimajor axis 4 and semiminor axis 3 as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/fW7gEPB1EUYaabtQE4RFy6IX7sVoRyKeu.png)
Figure 7.8 Graph of the plane curve described by the parametric equations in part b.

As t progresses from O to 2π a point on the curve traverses the ellipse once,in a counterclockwise direction.Recal from the section opener that the orbit of Earth around the Sun is also elliptical. This is a perfect example of using parameterized curves to model a real-world phenomenon.

7.2 Eliminate the parameter for the plane curve defined by the following parametric equations and describe the resulting graph.

x(t)=2+3/t, y(t)=t-1, 2≤t≤6

So far we have seen the method ofeliminating the parameter assuminq weknow a set of parametric equations that describe a plane curve. What if we would like to start with the equation of a curve and determine a pair of parametric equations for that curve? This is certainly possible, and in fact it is possible to do so in many different ways for a given curve. The process is known as parameterization of a curve

## EXAMPLE 7.3

### Parameterizing a Curve

Find two different pairs of parametric equations to represent the graph of $y=2x^{2}-3$

![](./images/fmQSB7P0Z7id5g0ms5Ffzn6lSDaNHNnT3.png)

### Solution

First, it is always possible to parameterize a curve by defining x(t)=t ,then replacing xwith tin the equation for $y(t)$ This gives the parameterization

x(t)=t, y(t)=2t²-3.

Since there is no restriction on the domain in the original graph, there is no restriction on the values of t

We have complete freedom in the choice for the second parameterization. For example, we can choose x(t) = 3t - 2 The only thing we need to check is that there are no restrictions imposed on $X$, that is, the range of x(t) is all real numbers. This is the case for x(t) = 3t - 2 . Now since $y=2x^{2}-3$ ,we can substitute x(t) = 3t - 2 for $x.$ This gives

y(t) = 2(3t-2)² - 3 = 2(9t² - 12t + 4) - 3 = 18t² - 24t + 8 - 3 = 18t² - 24t + 5.

Therefore,a second parameterization of the curve can be written as

x(t) = 3t - 2 and y(t) = 18t² - 24t + 5

7.3 Find two different sets of parametric equations to represent the graph of $y=x^2+2x.$

# Cycloids and Other Parametric Curves

Imagine going on a bicycle ride through the country. The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable pattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side of the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a cycloid (Figure 7.9). A cycloid generated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations

x(t) = a(t - sin t), y(t) = a(1 - cos t)

To see why this is true, consider the path that the center of the wheel takes. The center moves along the x-axis at a constant height equal to the radius of the wheel. If the radius is a, then the coordinates of the center can be given by the equations

x(t) = at, y(t) = a

for any value of t. Next, consider the ant, which rotates around the center along a circular path. If the bicycle is moving from left to right then the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction. A possible parameterization of the circular motion of the ant (relative to the center of the wheel) is given by

x(t)=-asin t, y(t)=-acos t

(The negative sign is needed to reverse the orientation of the curve. If the negative sign were not there, we would have to imagine the wheel rotating counterclockwise.) Adding these equations together gives the equations for the cycloid

x(t) = a(t - sin t), y(t) = a(1 - cos t)

![](./images/f8gSBVGQegorSylQC7ukRebPE92pyMGsN.png)

Figure 7.9 A wheel traveling along a road without slipping; the point on the edge of the wheel traces out a cycloid

Now suppose that the bicycle wheel doesn't travel along a straight road but instead moves along the inside of a larger wheel, as in Eigure 7.10. In this graph, the green circle is traveling around the blue circle in a counterclockwise direction A point on the edge of the green circle traces out the red graph, which is called a hypocycloid.

![](./images/fBHEqr4IryfmuQdBPwg2ZUvzrbX95xVhm.png)
Figure 7.10 Graph of the hypocycloid described by the parametric equations shown.

The general parametric equations for a hypocycloid are.

x(t) = (a - b)cos t + bcos((a - b)/b)t; y(t) = (a - b)sin t - bsin((a - b)/b)t

These equations are a bit more complicated, but the derivation is somewhat similar to the equations for the cycloid. In this case we assume the radius of the larqer circle is a and the radius of the smaller circle is b. Then the center of the wheel travels along a circleof radius $a-b$ .This fact explains the first term in each equation above.The period of the second trigonometric function in both x(t) and $y(t)$ is equal to 2πb/(a-b)

The ratio a/b is related to the number of cusps on the graph (cusps are the corners or pointed ends of the graph), as illustrated in Figure 7.11. This ratio can lead to some very interesting graphs, depending on whether or not the ratio is rational. Figure 7.10 corresponds to $a=4$ and $b=1$ .The result is a hypocycloid with four cusps.Fiqure 7.11 shows some other possibilities. The last two hypocycloids have irrational values for a/b . In these cases the hypocycloids have an infinite number of cusps, so they never return to their starting point. These are examples of what are known as space-filling curves.

### STUDENT PROJECT

## The Witch of Agnesi

 Many plane curves in mathematics are named after the people who first investigated them, like the folium of Descartes or the spiral of Archimedes. However, perhaps the strangest name for a curve is the witch of Agnesi. Why a witch?

 Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718-1799) was one of the few recognized women mathematicians of eighteenth-centur Italy. She wrote a popular book on analytic geometry, published in 1748, which included an interesting curve that had been studied by Fermat in 1630. The mathematician Guido Grandi showed in 1703 how to construct this curve, which he later called the “versoria,” a Latin term for a rope used in sailing. Agnesi used the Italian term for this rope, "versiera, but in Latin, this same word means a “female goblin. When Agnesi's book was translated into English in 1801, the translator used the term "witch" for the curve, instead of rope. The name“witch of Agnesi” has stuck ever since.

The witch of Agnesi is a curve defined as follows: Start with a circle of radius a so that the points (0,0) and $(0,2a)$ are points on the circle (Figure 7.12). Let O denote the origin. Choose any other point A on the circle, and draw the secant line OA. Let B denote the point at which the line OA intersects the horizontal line through $(0,2a)$ . The vertical line through Bintersects the horizontal line through A at the point P. As the point A varies, the path that the point P travels is the witch of Agnesi curve for the given circle.

Witch of Agnesi curves have applications in physics, including modeling water waves and distributions of spectral lines. In probability theory, the curve describes the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution.In this project you will parameterize these curves

### STUDENTPROJECT

## Travels with My Ant: The Curtate and Prolate Cycloids

Earlier in this section, we looked at the parametric equations for a cycloid, which is the path a point on the edge of a wheel traces as the wheel rolls along a straight path. In this project we look at two different variations of the cycloid, called the curtate and prolate cycloids.

First, let's revisit the derivation of the parametric equations for a cycloid. Recall that we considered a tenacious ant trying to get home by hanging onto the edge of a bicycle tire. We have assumed the ant climbed onto the tire at the very edge, where the tire touches the ground. As the wheel rolls, the ant moves with the edge of the tire (Figure 7.13)

As we have discussed, we have a lot of flexibility when parameterizing a curve. In this case we let our parameter t represent the angle the tire has rotated through. Looking at Figure 7.13, we see that after the tire has rotated through an angle of t, the position of the center of the wheel, $C=(x_{C},y_{C})$ , is given by

xC = at and yC = a

Furthermore, letting $A=(x_A,y_A)$ denote the position of the ant, we note that.

xᴄ-xᴀ=asin t and yᴄ-yᴀ=acos t

Then

Fiqure 7.13(a)The antclings to the edqe of thebicycle tire as the tirerolls along the qround.(b) Using qeometry tc determine the position of the ant after the tire has rotated through an angle of t

Note that these are the same parametric representations we had before, but we have now assigned a physical meaning to the parametric variable t.

After a while the ant is getting dizzy from going round and round on the edge of the tire. So he climbs up one of the spokes toward the center of the wheel. By climbing toward the center of the wheel, the ant has changed his path of motion. The new path has less up-and-down motion and is called a curtate cycloid (Eigure Z.14). As shown in the figure, we let b denote the distance along the spoke from the center of the wheel to the ant. As before, we let t represent the angle the tire has rotated through. Additionally, we let $C=(x_{C},y_{C})$ represent the position of the center of the wheel and $A=(x_{A},y_{A})$ represent the position of the ant.

2.Use geometry to find expressions for $x_C-x_A$ and for $y_C-y_A$ 3. On the basis of your answers to parts 1 and 2, what are the parametric equations representing the curtate

cycloid?

Once the ant's head clears, he realizes that the bicyclist has made a turn, and is now traveling away from his home. So he drops off the bicycle tire and looks around. Fortunately, there is a set of train tracks nearby, headed back in the right direction. So the ant heads over to the train tracks to wait. After a while, a train goes by, heading in the right direction, and he manages to jump up and just catch the edge of the train wheel (without getting squished!)

The ant is still worried about getting dizzy, but the train wheel is slippery and has no spokes to climb, so he decides to just hang on to the edge of the wheel and hope for the best. Now, train wheels have a flange to keep the wheel running on the tracks. So, in this case, since the ant is hanging on to the very edge of the flange, the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is actually greater than the radius of the wheel (Eigure Z.15) The setup here is essentially the same as when the ant climbed up the spoke on the bicycle wheel. We let b denote the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant, and we let trepresent the angle the tire has rotated through. Additionally, we let $C=(x_{C},y_{C})$ represent the positionof thecenter of the wheel and $A=(x_A,y_A)$ represent the position of the ant (Figure 7.15)

When the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is greater than the radius of the wheel, his path of motion is called a prolate cycloid. A graph of a prolate cycloid is shown in the figure.

4.Using the same approach you used in parts 1- 3, find the parametric equations for the path of motion of the ant. 5.What do you notice about your answer to part 3 and your answer to part 4?

Notice that the ant is actually traveling backward at times (the “loops" in the graph), even though the train continues to move forward. He is probably going to be really dizzy by the time he gets home!

Learning Objectives

Now that we have introduced the concept of a parameterized curve, our next step is to learn how to work with this concept in the context of calculus.For example, if we know a parameterization of a given curve, is it possible to calculate the slope of a tangent line to the curve? How about the arc length of the curve? Or the area under the curve?

Another scenario: Suppose we would like to represent the location of a baseball after the ball leaves a pitcher's hand. If the position of the baseball is represented by the plane curve (x(t), y(t)) , then we should be able to use calculus to find the speed of the ball at any given time.Furthermore, we should be able to calculate just how far that ballhas traveled as a function of time.

# Derivatives of Parametric Equations.

We start by asking how to calculate the slope of a line tangent to a parametric curve at a point. Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations


x(t) = 2t+3, y(t) = 3t-4, -2 ≤ t ≤ 3

The graph of this curve appears in Figure 7.16. It is a line segment starting at (-1,-10) and ending at (9,5)

![](./images/fNy2UCfmiMbVaeYusRKKqR8txUofTCNRf.png)
Figure7.16Graph of the line segment described by the given parametric equations.

We can eliminate the parameter by first solving the equation. $x(t)=2t+3$ for t.

x(t) = 2t+3, x-3 = 2t, t = (x-3)/2

Substituting this into $y(t)$ ,we obtain

y(t)=3t-4, y=3((x-3)/2)-4, y=(3x)/2-(9/2)-4, y=(3x)/2-(17/2)

The slope of this line is given by dy/dx=3/2 . Next we calculate x' x x'(t) and y y' y'(t) This gives x'(t)=2 and y'(t)=3. Notice that dy/dx=(dy/dt)/(dx/dt)=3/2 This is no coincidence as outlined in the following theorem.

### Theorem 7.1

Derivative of Parametric Equations

Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations x = x(t) and $y= y( t)$ . Suppose that x'(t) and y' (t) exist, and assume that x'(t) ≠ 0 Then the derivativeis given by

dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = y'(t)/x'(t).

## Proof

This theorem can be proven using the Chain Rule. In particular, assume that the parameter t can be eliminated, yielding a differentiable function $y=F(x)$ . Then y(t) = F(x(t)) Differentiating both sides of this equation using the Chain Rule yields

y'(t) = F'(x(t))x'(t),

S0

F'(x(t))=y'(t)/x'(t).

But F'(x(t)) = dy/dx , which proves the theorem.

口

Equation 7.1 can be used to calculate derivatives of plane curves, as well as critical points. Recall that a critical point of a differentiable functione $y=f(x)$ is any point $x=x_0$ such that either f'(x₀) = 0 or f′(x₀) does not exist. Equation 7.1 gives a formula for the slope of a tangent line to a curve defined parametrically regardless of whether the curve can be described by a function $y=f(x)$ or not.

# EXAMPLE 7.4

### Finding the Derivative of a Parametric Curve

Calculate the derivativee dy/dx for each of the following parametrically defined plane curves, and locate any critical points on their respective graphs.

x(t) = t² - 3, y(t) = 2t - 1, -3 ≤ t ≤ 4; x(t) = 2t + 1, y(t) = t³ - 3t + 4, -2 ≤ t ≤ 5; x(t) = 5cos t, y(t) = 5sin t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π

## $②$ Solution

a.To apply Equation 7.1, first calculate x' (t) and y'(t)

x'(t)=2t, y'(t)=2

Next substitute these into the equation:

dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt), dy/dx = 2/(2t), dy/dx = 1/t

This derivative is undefined when $t=0$ . Calculating x(0) and $y(0)$ gives x(0)=(0)²-3=-3 and y(0)=2(0)-1=-1 , which corresponds to the point (-3,-1) on the graph.The graph of this curve is a parabola

opening to the right, and the point (-3,-1) is its vertex as shown.

![](./images/fgguFPTAaIs2xt0GeeS4eRM2KGDbrfeG0.png)
Figure 7.17 Graph of the parabola described by parametric equations in part a.

b.To apply Equation 7.1, first calculate x' (t) and y(t)
v'(t): x'(t)=2; y'(t)=3t²-3.

Next substitute these into the equation

dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt); dy/dx = (3t² - 3)/2.

This derivative is zero when t=±1 When $t=-1$ we have x(-1)=2(-1)+1=-1 and y(-1)=(-1)³-3(-1)+4=-1+3+4=6,

which corresponds to the point (-1,6) on the graph. When $t=1$ we have x(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3 and y(1)=(1)³-3(1)+4=1-3+4=2,

which corresponds to the point (3,2) on the graph. The point (3,2) is a relative minimum and the point (-1,6) is a relative maximum, as seen in the following graph.

![](./images/fcoXXtgR9D5LQEKyokNai2Wi9xbcAc6fs.png)

Figure 7.18 Graph of the curve described by parametric equations in part b.

C.To apply Equation Z.1,first calculate x' (t) and y'(t):
y'(t): x'(t)=-5sin t, y'(t)=5cos t

Next substitute these into the equation:


dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = 5cost/(-5sint) = -cott

This derivative is zero when cos $t=0$ and is undefined when sin $t=0$ This gives t=0,，π,3，and 2π as critica points for $t.$ Substituting each of these into x(t) and $y(t)$ ,we obtain



$I$|$x(t)$|$y(t)$
0|5|0
π/2|0|5
π|-5|0
3π/2 1 14 1 1|0|.5
7|5|T 1

These points correspond to the sides, top, and bottom of the circle that is represented by the parametric equations (Fiqure7.19).On the left and riqht edges of the circle,the derivative is undefined,and on the top and bottom,the derivative equals zero

Calculate the derivative dy/dx for the plane curve defined by the equations

and locate any critical points on its graph.

# EXAMPLE 7.5

### Finding a TangentLine

Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve defined by the equations

x(t) = t² - 3, y(t) = 2t - 1, -3 ≤ t ≤ 4 when t = 2

## $②$ Solution First find the slope of the tangent line using Equation 7.1, which means calculating x' x' x'(t) and y'(t)

x'(t)=2t, y'(t)=2.

Nextsubstitute these into the equation

dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt), dy/dx = 2/(2t), dy/dx = 1/t

When $l=2$ ,=, so this is the slope of the tangent line. Calculating x(2) and $y(2)$ gives

x(2)=(2)²-3=1 and y(2)=2(2)-1=3

which corresponds to the point (1,3) on the graph (Figure 7.20). Now use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:

Figure 7.20 Tangent line to the parabola described by the given parametric equations when $t=2$

 7.5 Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve defined by the equations
x(t)=t²-4t, y(t)=2t³-6t, -2≤t≤10 when t=5.

### Second-Order Derivatives

Our next goal is to see how to take the second derivative of a function defined parametrically. The second derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ is defined to be the derivative of the first derivative; that is,

d²y/dx² = d/dx[dy/dx]

Since dy/dx=(dy/dt)/(dx/dt) ,we can replacethe $y$ on both sideso thiseqution with dy/dx This givesus

d²y/dx² = d/dx(dy/dx) = (d/dt)(dy/dx)/(dx/dt).

If we know dy/dx as a function of $t$, then this formula is straightforward to apply

# EXAMPLE 7.6

### Finding a Second Derivative Calculate the second derivative $d^2y/dx^2$ for the plane curve defined by the parametric equations


x(t) = t² - 3, y(t) = 2t - 1, -3 ≤ t ≤ 4

### $②$ Solution

From Example 7.4 we know that dy/dx=2/2t=1/t Using Equation 7.2, we obtain

d²y/dx²=(d/dt)(dy/dx)/(dx/dt)=((d/dt)(1/t))/(2t)=-t⁻²/2t=-1/(2t³)

7.6 Calculate the second derivative $d^2y/dx^2$ for the plane curve defined by the equations

x(t)=t²-4t, y(t)=2t³-6t, -2≤t≤3

 and locate any critical points on its graph

## Integrals Involving Parametric Equations

Now that we have seen how to calculate the derivative of a plane curve, the next question is this: How do we find the area under a curve defined parametrically? Recall the cycloid defined by the equations x(t) = t - sin t, y(t) = 1 - cos t Suppose we want to find the area of the shaded region in the following graph

![](./images/fwToItGp2cVtOteGhzgNI8kX8na5gmsPd.png)
Figure 7.21 Graph of a cycloid with the arch over [0,2π] highlighted

To derive a formula for the area under the curve defined by the functions

x=x(t), y=y(t), a≤t≤b

we assume that $x(t)$ is increasing on the interval t ∈ t ∈ t∈[a, $b]$ and x(t) is differentiable and start with an equal partition of the interval a ≤ t ≤ b Suppose t₀=a<t₁<t₂<⋯<tₙ=b and consider the following graph.

![](./images/flkfki630rzPGBhWvabCvMYBTwvZGna0n.png)

Figure 7.22 Approximating the area under a parametrically defined curve.

We use rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. The height of the ith rectangle is $y(t_{i-1}$ ), so an approximation to the area is

∑_{i=1}^ny(t_{i-1})(x(t_i)-x(t_{i-1})) = ∑_{i=1}^ny(t_{i-1})((x(t_i)-x(t_{i-1}))/(t_i-t_{i-1}))(t_i-t_{i-1}) →∫_a^by(t)x'(t)dt as max{(t_i-t_{i-1})}→0

This folow rom resut btaine in clulus forthe untion y(tᵢ₋₁)((x(tᵢ)-x(tᵢ₋₁))/(tᵢ-tᵢ₋₁))

Then a Riemann sum for the area is

Aₙ=Σᵢ₌₁ⁿy(t̄ᵢ)(x(tᵢ)-x(tᵢ₋₁))

Multiplying and dividing each area by $t_{i}-t_{i-1}$ gives

Aₙ = Σ_(i=1)^n y(x(t̄ᵢ))((x(tᵢ) - x(tᵢ₋₁))/(tᵢ - tᵢ₋₁))(tᵢ - tᵢ₋₁) = Σ_(i=1)^n y(x(t̄ᵢ))((x(tᵢ) - x(tᵢ₋₁))/Δt)Δt

Taking the limit as 72 approaches infinity gives


A = limₙ→∞ Aₙ = ∫ₐᵇ y(t)x'(t) dt

If $X$ is a decreasing function for 
a ≤ t ≤ b a similar derivation will show that the area is given by -∫ₐᵇy(t)x'(t)dt = ∫ₐᵇy(t)x'(t)dt

This leads to the following theorem.

### Theorem 7.2

### Area under a Parametric Curve

Consider the non-self-intersecting plane curve defined by the parametric equations

x=x(t), y=y(t), a≤t≤b

and assume that x(t) is differentiable. The area under this curve is given by

A = ∫ₐᵇ y(t)x'(t) dt

# EXAMPLE 7.7

### Finding the Area under a Parametric Curve

Find the area under the curve of the cycloid defined by the equations

x(t)=t-sin t, y(t)=1-cos t, 0≤t≤2π.

![](./images/ftGPyE9PXuXwB3NkFMpW1EY5A7YyaPu2d.png)

### Solution

Using Equation Z.3, we have

A = ∫ₐᵇ y(t)x'(t)dt = ∫₀²π(1-cos t)²dt = ∫₀²π(1-2cos t + cos²t)dt = ∫₀²π(3/2 - 2cos t + cos(2t)/2)dt = (3t/2 - 2sin t + sin(2t)/4)|₀²π = 3π

7.7 Find the area under the curve of the hypocycloid defined by the equations
x(t) = 3cos t + cos 3t, y(t) = 3sin t - sin 3t, 0 ≤ t ≤ π

# Arc Length of a Parametric Curve

In addition to finding the area under a parametric curve, we sometimes need to find the arc length of a parametric curve. In the case of a line segment, arc length is the same as the distance between the endpoints. If a particle travels from point A to point B along a curve, then the distance that particle travels is the arc length. To develop a formula for arc length, we start with an approximation by line segments as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/fZNLNRabwe3VgMrlBU7dvdOcGg2bgb2T5.png)

Figure 7.23Approximation of a curve by linesegments

Given a plane curve defined by the functions x=x(t), y=y(t), a≤t≤b 
a ≤ t ≤ b 
a ≤ t ≤ b we start by partitioning the interval $[a,b]$ into n equal subintervals: t₀=a<t₁<t₂<⋯<tₙ=b The width of each subinterval is given by Δt=(b-a)/n We can calculate thelength of eachline segment

d₁ = √((x(t₁) - x(t₀))² + (y(t₁) - y(t₀))²)  d₂ = √((x(t₂) - x(t₁))² + (y(t₂) - y(t₁))²) etc.

Then add these up. We let 5 denote the exact arc length and $s_{n}$ denote the approximation by $n$ line segments

s≈∑ₖ₌₁ⁿsₖ=∑ₖ₌₁ⁿ√((x(tₖ)-x(tₖ₋₁))²+(y(tₖ)-y(tₖ₋₁))²)

If we assume that x(t) and $y(t)$ are differentiable functions of $t_r$ then the Mean Value Theorem (Introduction to the Applications of Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction)) applies.so in eact subinterval $[t_{k-1},t_k]$ there exist t̂ₖ and $7_{k}$ such that

x(tₖ)-x(tₖ₋₁)=x'(t̂ₖ)(tₖ-tₖ₋₁)=x'(t̂ₖ)Δt y(tₖ)-y(tₖ₋₁)=y'(t̃ₖ)(tₖ-tₖ₋₁)=y'(t̃ₖ)Δt.

Therefore Equation 7.4 becomes

![](./images/fDPoNxryk5O6rscieYsXMfgVcGmxoy3Dc.png)

This is a Riemann sum that approximates the arc length over apartition of the interval $[a,b]$ .If we further assume that the derivatives are continuous and let the number of points in the partition increase without bound, the approximatior approaches the exact arc length. This gives

![](./images/fnYlh1K8WUtOGoDdOKfbohMgsH348DdA9.png)

When taking the limit, the values of îₖ and Ĩₖ are both contained within the same ever-shrinking interval of width f, so they must converge to the same value.

We can summarize this method in the following theorem

## Theorem 7.3

Arc Length of a Parametric Curve

Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations

 x=x(t), y=y(t), t₁≤t≤t₂ 

and assume that x(t) and $y(t)$ are differentiable functions of t.Then the arc lengthof this curve is givenby

s=∫_(t₁)^(t₂)√((dx/dt)²+(dy/dt)²)dt

At this point a side derivation leads to a previous formula for arc length. In particular, suppose the parameter can be eliminated, leading to a function $y= F( x)$ . Then $y(t)=F(x(t))$ and the Chain Rule gives y'(t) = F'(x(t))x'(t) Substituting this into Equation 7.5 gives

s=∫ₜ₁ₜ₂√((dx/dt)²+(dy/dt)²)dt =∫ₜ₁ₜ₂√((dx/dt)²+(F'(x)dx/dt)²)dt =∫ₜ₁ₜ₂√((dx/dt)²(1+(F'(x))²))dt =∫ₜ₁ₜ₂x'(t)√(1+(dy/dx)²)dt

Here we have assumed that x'(t) > 0 , which is a reasonable assumption. The Chain Rule gives dx=x'(t) dt, anc letting a=x(tₗ) and 
b=x(t₂) we obtain the formula

s=∫ₐᵇ√(1+(dy/dx)²)dx

which is the formula for arc length obtained in the Introduction to the Applications of Integration

EXAMPLE 7.8

### Finding the Arc Length of a Parametric Curve Find the arc lenqth of the semicircle defined by the equations

x(t)=3cos t, y(t)=3sin t, 0≤t≤π

## $①$ Solution

The values $t=0$ to t=π trace out the red curve in Figure 7.23. To determine its length, use Equation 7.5

S=∫_(t₁)^(t₂)√((dx/dt)²+(dy/dt)²)dt =∫_0^π√((-3sin t)²+(3cos t)²)dt =∫_0^π√(9sin²t+9cos²t)dt =∫_0^π√(9(sin²t+cos²t))dt =∫_0^π3dt=3t|_0^π=3π

Note that the formula for the arc length of a semicircle is πr and the radius of this circle is 3. This is a great example of using calculus to derive a known formula of a geometric quantity

![](./images/fxbY49HpmfXQmACpOpibEpXZ51y0shuKa.png)

Figure 7.24 The arc length of the semicircle is equal to its radius times π

7.8 Find the arc length of the curve defined by the equations

x(t)=3t², y(t)=2t³, 1≤t≤3

We nowreturn to the problemposed at thebeginning of thesection about a baseball leaving a pitcher's hand.Ignoring the effect of air resistance (unless it is a curve ball!),theball travels a parabolic path.Assuming the pitcher'shand is at the origin and the ball travels left to right in the direction of the positive $x.$ axis, the parametric equations for this curve can be written as

x(t) = 140t, y(t) = -16t²+2t

where trepresents time. We first calculate the distance the ball travels as a function of time. This distance is represented by the arc length. We can modify the arc length formula slightly. First rewrite the functions x(t) and y $(t)$ using v as an independent variable, so as to eliminate any confusion with the parameter t:

x(v) = 140v, y(v) = -16v² + 2v

Then we write the arc length formula as follows

s(t) = ∫₀ᵗ√((dx/dv)²+(dy/dv)²)dv = ∫₀ᵗ√(140²+(-32v+2)²)dv

The variable vacts as a dummy variable that disappears afterintegration,leaving the arc length as a function of time t To integrate this expression we can use a formula from AppendixA

∫√(a²+u²)du=(u/2)√(a²+u²)+(a²/2)ln|u+√(a²+u²)|+C

We set $a=140$ and $u=-32v+2$ . This gives $du=-32dv$ ,So 
dv = -(1/32)du Therefor

∫√(140²+(-32v+2)²)dv = -(1/32)∫√(a²+u²)du = -(1/32)[((-32v+2)/2)√(140²+(-32v+2)²) + (140²/2)ln|(-32v+2)+√(140²+(-32v+2)²) |] + C

and

s(t) = -(1/32)[((-32t+2)/2)√(140²+(-32t+2)²) + (140²/2)ln|(-32t+2)+√(140²+(-32t+2)²) |] + (1/32)[√(140²+2²) + (140²/2)ln|2+√(140²+2²) |] = ((t/2)-(1/32))√(1024t²-128t+19604) - (1225/4)ln|(-32t+2)+√(1024t²-128t+19604)| + √19604/32 + (1225/4)ln(2+√19604)

This function represents the distance traveled by the ball as a function of time. To calculate the speed, take the derivative of this function with respect to t. while this may seem like a daunting task, it is possible to obtain the answer directly from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:

d/dx∫ₐˣf(u)du = f(x).

Therefore

s′(t)=d/dt[s(t)]=d/dt[∫₀ᵗ√(140²+(−32v+2)²)dv]=√(140²+(−32t+2)²)=√(1024t²−128t+19604)=2√(256t²−32t+4901)

One third of a second after the ball leaves the pitcher's hand, the distance it travels is eaual tc

## Surface Area Generated by a Parametric Curve

Recall the problem of finding the surface area of a volume of revolution. In Curve Length and Surface Area, we derived a formula for finding the surface area of a yolume generated by a fur the x-axis:

S = 2π∫ₐᵇf(x)√(1+(f'(x))²)dx 

We now consider a volume of revolution generated by revolving a parametrically defined curve x=x(t), y=y(t), a≤t≤b around the X-axis as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fkokfTAh6liE0mMZRtrS2Lw8kmYDffSQQ.png)

Figure 7.25 A surface of revolution generated by a parametrically defined curve.

The analogous formula for a parametrically defined curve is

S = 2π ∫ₐᵇ y(t)√(x'(t)² + y'(t)²) dt

provided that $y(t)$ is not negative on $[a,b]$

### $②$ Solution

Figure 7.26 A semicircle generated by parametric equations.

When this curve is revolved around the x-axis, it generates a sphere of radius $r.$ To calculate the surface areaof the sphere, we use Equation 7.6

S = 2π∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>y(t)√((x'(t))²+(y'(t))²)dt = 2π∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>r sin t√((-r sin t)²+(r cos t)²)dt = 2π∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>r sin t√(r²(sin²t+cos²t))dt = 2π∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>r² sin t dt = 2πr²( -cos t|<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>) = 2πr²(-cosπ+cos0) = 4πr²

This is, in fact, the formula for the surface area of a sphere.

# 7.3 Polar Coordinates

## Learning Objectives

7.3.1 Locate points in a plane by using polar coordinates 7.3.2Convert points between rectangular and polar coordinates.. 7.3.3 Sketch polar curves from given equations. 7.3.4 Convert equations between rectangular and polar coordinates 7.3.5 Identify symmetry in polar curves and equations.

The rectangular coordinate system (or Cartesian plane) provides a means of mapping points to ordered pairs and ordered pairs to points. This is called a one-to-one mapping from points in the plane to ordered pairs. The polar coordinate system provides an alternative method of mapping points to ordered pairs. In this section we see that in some circumstances, polar coordinates can be more useful than rectangular coordinates.

## Defining Polar Coordinates

To find the coordinates of a point in the polar coordinate system, consider Figure 7.27. The point $P$ has Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ . The line segment connecting the origin to the point $P$ measures the distance from the origin to $P$ and has length r. The angle between the positive X -axis and the line segment has measure θ This observation suggests a natural correspondence between the coordinate paire $(x,y)$ and the values r and θ .This correspondence is the basis of the polar coordinate system. Note that every point in the Cartesian plane has two values (hence the term ordered pair) associated with it.In the polar coordinate system,each point also has two values associated with it: $r$ and 6

![](./images/fK4agwOeEswpeOwMMDz7Bsug0uWIGpMPb.png)
Figure 7.27An arbitrary point in the Cartesian plane

Using right-triangle trigonometry, the following equations are true for the point $P$

cosθ=x/r sin x=rcosθ sinθ=y/r sin y=r sinθ

Furthermore,

r²=x²+y² and tanθ=y/x

Each point $(x,y)$ in the Cartesian coordinate system can therefore be represented as an ordered pair (r,θ) in the polar coordinate system.The first coordinate is called the radial coordinate and the second coordinate is called the angular coordinate.Every point in the plane can be represented in this form.

Note that the equation tan θ = y/x has an infinite number of solutions for any ordered pair $(x,y)$ . However, if we restrict the solutions to values between O and 2π then we can assign a unique solution to the quadrant in which the origina point $(x,y)$ is located.Then the corresponding value of r is positive, so $r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$

### Theorem 7.4

### Converting Points between Coordinate Systems Given a point $P$ in the plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ and polar coordinates (r, θ) , the following conversion

formulas hold true

x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ

r² = x² + y² and tan θ = y/x.

These formulas can be used to convert from rectangular to polar or from polar to rectangular coordinates.

### EXAMPLE 7.10

Converting between Rectangular and Polar Coordinates Convert each of the following points into polar coordinates.

a.(1,1) b. (-3,4) C. (0,3) d. 5√3, 5)

Convert each of the following points into rectangular coordinates.

e. (3,π/3) f. (2, 3π/2)

9. (6,-5π/6)

### $①$ Solution

a.Use $x=1$ and $y=1$ in Equation Z.8

r² = x²+y² = 1²+1²; r = √2 and tanθ = y/x = 1/1=1; θ = π/4.

Therefore this point can be represented as (√2, π/4) in polar coordinates

b.Use $x=-3$ and $y=4$ in Equation 7.8
tanθ = y/x, x²+y² = (-3)²+(4)² and -4/3, r = 5, θ = -arctan(4/3) ≈ 2.21

Therefore this point can be represented as (5,2.21) in polar coordinates C.Use $x=0$ and $y=3$ in Equation 7.8

r² = x² + y² = 3² + 0² = 9 + 0 and tanθ = y/x = 3/0. r = 3

Direct application of the second equation leads to division by zero. Graphing the point (0,3) on the rectangular coordinate system reveals that the point is located on the positive y-axis.The angle between the positive x-axis and the positive y-axis is π/2 Therefore this point can be represented as (3, π/2) in polar coordinates

d.Use x = 5√3 and $y=-5$ in Equation 7.8
-5limEqualon/... r²=x²+y²=(5√3)²+(-5)²=75+25 r=10 and tanθ=y/x=-5/(5√3)=-√3/3 θ=-π/6.

Therefore this point can be represented as (10, -π/6) in polar coordinates.

e. Use $r=3$ and θ=π/3 in Equation Z.7
lattoll T.L. y=r sin θ, x=r cos θ, y=3sin(π/3) = 3(1/2) = 3/2, x=3cos(π/3) = 3(√3/2) = (3√3)/2

Therefore tis oin an be epreented as (3/2, 3√3/2) in ectangulr cordinate f.Use $r=2$ and θ=3π/2 in Equation Z.7

ILLLLLL = rcosθ, y = rsinθ = 2cos(3π/2) and = 2sin(3π/2) = 2(0)=0 and = 2(-1)=-2

Therefore this point can be represented as (0,-2) in rectangular coordinates

g.Use $r=6$ and θ=-5π/6 in Equation Z.7

一 = rcosθ = 6cos(-5π/6) = 6(-√3/2) = -3√3 and 一 = rsinθ = 6sin(-5π/6) = 6(-1/2) = -3.

Therefoe tis point can be represented as (-3√3, -3) in rectang ular cordinates.

![](./images/fbRymacYu1OmkxUfqlGgCbz9gBnXGpD62.png)

7.10 Convert (8, 8) into polar coordinates and (4,2π/3) into rectangular coordinates

The polarrepresentation of a point is not unique.For example, the polarcoordinates (2, π/3) and (2,7π/3) both represent the point (1,√3) inthe rectangular system.Also, the value of $r$ can be negative. Therefore, the point with polar coordinates (-2,4π/3) also represents the point (1,√3) in the rectangular system, as we can see by using Equation 7.8

![](./images/f4hfTTGaEibeK8ZDdBsdbgg47PF667lme.png)

Every point in the plane has an infinite number of representations in polar coordinates. However, each point in the plane has only one representation in the rectangular coordinate system.

Note that the polar representation of a point in the plane also has a visual interpretation.In particular, $r$ is the directed distance that the point lies from the origin, and θ measures the angle that the line segment from the origin to the point makes with the positive. $x$ axis. Positive angles are measured in a counterclockwise direction and negative angles are measured in a clockwise direction. The polar coordinate system appears in the following figure

![](./images/fpCC3hfFNOak1PHIAf9gkfrYgVsXygGuZ.png)
Figure 7.28 The polar coordinate system.

The line segment starting from the center of the graph going to the right (called the positive x-axis in the Cartesian system) is the polar axis.The center point is the pole, or origin, of the coordinate system, and corresponds to $r=0$ .The

innermost circle shown in Figure 7.28 contains all points a distance of 1 unit from the pole, and is represented by the equation $r=1$ .Then $r=2$ is the set of points 2 units from the pole, and so on. The line segments emanating from the pole correspond to fixed angles. To plot a point in the polar coordinate system, start with the angle. If the angle is positive, then measure the angle from the polar axis in a counterclockwise direction. If it is negative, then measure it clockwise. If the value of $r$ is positive, move that distance along the terminal ray of the angle. If it is negative, move along the ray that is opposite the terminal ray of the given angle.

7.11 Plot (4, ) and (-3,-7π/2) on the polar plane.

## Polar Curves

Now that we know how to plot points in the polar coordinate system, we can discuss how to plot curves. In the rectangular coordinate system, we can graph a function $y=f(x)$ and create a curve in the Cartesian plane. In a similar fashion, we can graph a curve that is generated by a function r = f(θ)

The general idea behind graphing a function in polar coordinates is the same as graphing a function in rectangular coordinates. Start with a list of values for the independent variable ( 6 in this case) and calculate the corresponding values of the dependent variable r. This process generates a list of ordered pairs, which can be plotted in the polar coordinate system.Finally, connect the points, and take advantage of any patterns that may appear. The function may be periodic, for example, which indicates that only a limited number of values for the independent variable are needed.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Plotting a Curve in Polar Coordinates

1.Create a table with two columns. The first column is for θ, and the second column is for r.

2.Create a list of values for θ 3.Calculate the corresponding r values for each θ. 4.Plot each ordered pair (r,θ) on the coordinate axes. 5.Connect the points and look for a pattern

### EXAMPLE 7.12

# Graphing a Function in Polar Coordinates Graph the curve defined by the function r = 4sinθ Identify the curve and rewrite the equation in rectangular

### Solution

Because the function is a multiple of a sine function, it is periodic with period 2π , so use values for θ between 0 and 2π The result of steps 1-3 appear in the following table. Figure 7.30 shows the graph based on this table

![](./images/fyRc6ONxgG13ANyY9IUpQ1B3YNvSrM7Cp.png)
Figure 7.30 The graph of the function $r=4$ sin θ is a circle.

This is the graph of a circle. The equation $r=4$ sin θ can be converted into rectangular coordinates by first multiplying both sides by $P.$ This gives the equation r²=4rsinθ Next use the facts that $r^2=x^2+y^2$ and y=rsinθ . This gives $x^{2}+y^{2}=4y$ To put this equation into standard form, subtract 4y from both sides of the equation and complete the square:

x² + y² - 4y = 0; x² + (y² - 4y) = 0; x² + (y² - 4y + 4) = 4; x² + (y - 2)² = 4

This is the equation of a circle with radius 2 and center (0,2) in the rectangular coordinate system.

7.12 Create a graph of the curve defined by the function r = 4+4cosθ

The graph in Example 7.12 was that of a circle. The equation of the circle can be transformed into rectangular coordinates using the coordinate transformation formulas in Equation 7.8. Example 7.14 gives some more examples of functions for transforming from polar to rectangular coordinates.

## EXAMPLE 7.13

### Transforming Polar Equations to Rectangular Coordinates

Rewrite each of the following equations in rectangular coordinates and identify the graph.

a. θ=π/3 b. $r=3$ C.r =6 cos θ-8 sinθ

## (∘) Solution

a.Take the tangent of both sides.This gives tan θ = tan(π/3) = √3 Since tan θ = y/x we can replace the left-hand side of this equation by $y/x$ . This gives  y/x=√3  , which can be rewritten as y = x√3 This is the equation of a straight line passing through the origin with slope √3 In general, any polar equation of the form θ=K represents a straight line through the pole with slope equal to tan $K$ b.First,square both sides of the equation.This gives $r^{2}=9$ . Next replace $r^2$ with $x^{2}+y^{2}.$ This gives the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=9$ ,which is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 3.In general, any polar equation of the form $r=k$ where $k$ is a positive constant represents a circle of radius $k$ centered at the origin. (Note: when squaring both sides of an equation it is possible to introduce new points unintentionally. This should always be

taken into consideration.However, in this case we do not introduce new points.For example, 
(-3, π/3) is thesame point as (3,4π/3).

c.Multiply both sides of the equation by $r$ This leads to r² = 6rcosθ - 8rsinθ Next use the formulas $r^{2}= x^{2}+ y^{2}$, x = rcos θ, y = r sin θ

This gives

r²=6(rcosθ)-8(rsinθ), x²+y²=6x-8y

To put this equation into standard form,first move the variablesfrom theright-hand sideof the equation to theleft hand side, then complete the square.
x²+y² = 6x-8y; x²-6x+y²+8y=0; (x²-6x)+(y²+8y)=0; (x²-6x+9)+(y²+8y+16)=9+16; (x-3)²+(y+4)²=25

This is the equation of a circle with center at (3,-4) and radius5.Notice that the circle passes through the origin since the center is 5 units away.

We have now seen several examples of drawing graphs of curves defined by polar equations. A summary of some common curves is given in the tables below. In each equation, a and b are arbitrary constants

A cardioid is a special case of a limacon (pronounced “lee-mah-son"), in which $a=b$ or $a=-b$ . The rose is a very interesting curve. Notice that the graph of $r=3$ sin 2θ has four petals. However, the graph of $r=3$ sin 3θ has three petals as shown.

![](./images/fTR0EPR7qxnWoTzZBU9Gsnad0hQbeNeL4.png)
Figure7.33 Graph of r = 3sin(3θ)

If the coefficient of θ is even, the graph has twice as many petals as the coefficient. If the coefficient of θ is odd, then the number of petals equals the coefficient. You are encouraged to explore why this happens. Even more interesting graphs emerge when the coefficient of θ is not an integer. For example, if it is rational, then the curve is closed; that is, it eventually ends where it started (Figure 7.34(a)). However, if the coefficient is irrational, then the curve never closes (Figure 7.34(b)). Although it may appear that the curve is closed, a closer examination reveals that the petals just above the positive $x$ axis are slightly thicker. This is because the petal does not quite match up with the starting point

Figure 7.34 Polar rose graphs of functions with (a) rational coefficient and (b) irrational coefficient. Note that the rose in

part (b) does not fill the disk of radius 3 centered at the origin, even though it appears to. To see this, just note that for any fixed ray from the origin, there are only a countable number of values of theta for which we get a point on the graph along that ray. What we can say, though, is that for any point in the disk, there are points as close as you please to that point on the given graph.

### EXAMPLE 7.14

### Chapter Opener: Describing a Spiral

Recall the chambered nautilus introduced in the chapter opener This creature displays a spiral when half the outer shell is cut away. It is possible to describe a spiral using rectangular coordinates. Fiqure 7.35 shows a spiral in rectangular coordinates. How can we describe this curve mathematically?



![](./images/fLV73x5vM99Z6t1SqkYQGW0Ve1IvrxBz3.png)

Figure 7.36 A logarithmic spiral is similar to the shape of the chambered nautilus shell. (credit: modification of work by Jitze Couperus, Flickr)

Suppose a curve is described in the polar coordinate system via the function r = f(θ). Since we have conversion formulas from polar to rectangular coordinates given by

x=rcosθ, y=rsinθ

it is possible to rewrite these formulas using the function

x=f(θ)cosθ, y=f(θ)sinθ

This step gives a parameterization of the curve in rectangular coordinates using θ as the parameter. For example, the spiral formula r = a + bθ fromFigure 7.31 becomes

x = (a + bθ)cosθ, y = (a + bθ)sinθ

Letting θ range from -∞ to ∞ generates the entire spiral

# Symmetry in Polar Coordinates.

When studying symmetry of functions in rectangular coordinates (i.e., in the form $y=f(x))$ ,we talk about symmetry with respect to the y-axis and symmetry with respect to the origin. In particular, if $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $X$ in the domain of $f.$ then $f$ is an even function and its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. If $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $X$ in the domain of $f$ ,then $f$ is an odd function and its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. By determining which types of symmetry a graph exhibits, we can learn more about the shape and appearance of the graph. Symmetry can also reveal other properties of the function that generates the graph. Symmetry in polar curves works in a similar fashion

### Theorem 7.5

### Symmetry in Polar Curves and Equations

Consider a curve generated by the function r=f(θ) in polar coordinates

i.The curve is symmetric about the polar axis if for every point (r,θ) on the graph, the point 
(r,-θ) is also on the graph. Similarly, the equation. r = f(θ) is unchanged by replacing θ with -θ il.The curve is symmetric about the pole if for every point (r,θ) on the graph, the point (r,π+θ) is also on the graph. Similarly, the equation. r=f(θ) is unchanged when replacing r with $-r$, or θ with π + θ ili.The curve is symmetric about the vertical line θ = π/2 if for every point (r,θ) on the graph, the point (r, π-θ) is

EXAMPLE 7.15

## $②$ Solution

Suppose the point (r,θ) is on the graph of $r=3$ r = 3 r=3sin(2θ)

i.To test for symmetry about the polar axis, first try replacing θ with -θ This gives r =3 $r=3$ r=3sin(2(-θ))=-3sin(2θ) Since this changes the original equation, this test is not satisfied.However returning to the original equation anc replacing r with $-r$ and θ with π - θ yields

-r = 3sin(2(π-θ)) -r = 3sin(2π-2θ) -r = 3sin(-2θ) -r = -3sin2θ.

Multiplying both sides of this equation by -1 gives $r=3$ sin 20, which is the original equation. This demonstrates that the graph is symmetric with respect to the polar axis

ii.To test for symmetry with respect to the pole, first replace $r$ with $-r$ ,which yields $-r=3$ sin (2).Multiplying bott sides by -1 gives $r=-3$ sin (20) , which does not agree with the original equation. Therefore the equation does not pass the test for this symmetry. However, returning to the original equation and replacing θ with θ + π gives

vel, et ulining to trie oniginai equation al r = 3sin(2(θ+π)) = 3sin(2θ+2π) = 3(sin2θcos2π+cos2θsin2π) = 3sin2θ

Since this agrees with the original equation,the graph is symmetric about the pole.

ii.To test for symmetry with respect to the vertical line θ =,first replaceboth r with $-r$ and θ with -θ

-r=3sin(2(-θ)); -r=3sin(-2θ); -r=-3sin2θ

Multiplying both sides of this equation by -1 gives $r=3$ sin 20,which is the original equation.Therefore the graph is symmetric about the vertical line θ=π/2

This graph has symmetry with respect to the polar axis, the origin, and the vertical line going through the pole. To graph the function, tabulate values of θ between 0 and π/2 and then reflect the resulting graph

# 7.4 Area and Arc Length in Polar Coordinates

Learning Objectives

7.4.1Apply the formula for area of a region in polar coordinates. 7.4.2 Determine the arc length of a polar curve.

In the rectangular coordinate system, the definite integral provides a way to calculate the area under a curve. In particular, if we have a function $y=f(x)$ defined from $x=a$ to $x=b$ where f(x)>0 on this interval, the area between thecuvean the aisgie by A=∫_a^bf(x)dx . Tis act lon wit th o ula or vauatinghisintgat summarized in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Similarly, the arc length of this curve is given by L=∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>√(1+(f'(x))²)dx. In tis section we sud nlogos formuls or are n ar length n the olar condinat system.

## Areas of Regions Bounded by Polar Curves

We have studied the formulas for area under a curve defined in rectangular coordinates and parametrically defined curves. Now we turn our attention to deriving a formula for the area of a region bounded by a polar curve. Recall that the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus used the concept of a Riemann sum to approximate the area under a curve by using rectangles. For polar curves we use the Riemann sum again, but the rectangles are replaced by sectors of a circle.

Consider a curve defined by the function r = f(θ) ,where α≤θ≤β̄ . Our first step is to partition the interval [α, β] into n equal-width subintervals. The width of each subinterval is given by the formula Δθ = (β - α)/n ,and the ith partitior point θᵢ is given by the formula θᵢ=α+iΔθ .Each partition point θ=θᵢ defines a line with slope tanθᵢ passing through the pole as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/fNuYPxDgipyg4znMyyNyTKeFC6DiZ0Frk.png)
Figure 7.39 A partition of a typical curve in polar coordinates.

The line segments are connected by arcs of constant radius. This defines sectors whose areas can be calculated by using a geometric formula. The area of each sector is then used to approximate the area between successive line segments. We then sum the areas of the sectors to approximate the total area.This approach gives a Riemann sum approximation for the total area.The formula for the area of a sector of a circle is illustrated in the following figure.

![](./images/fXgAAzhgT7NZccCPRBfugTBpA5HrWo46o.png)
Figure 7.40 The area of a sector of a circe is given by A = (1/2)θr²

Recallthat the area of a circle is A=πr² . When measuring angles in radians, 360 degrees is equal to 2π radians Therefore a fraction of a circle can be measured by the central angle θ The fraction of the circle is given by θ/(2π) ,sothe areaof thesector is this fraction multiplied by the totalarea

A=(θ/(2π))πr²=(1/2)θr²

Since the radius of a typical sector in Figure 7.39 is given by rᵢ=f(θᵢ) , the area of the ith sector is given by

Aᵢ = ½(Δθ)(f(θᵢ))² 

Therefore aRiemann sum that approximates the area isgivenby


Aₙ = Σ_(i=1)^n Aᵢ ≈ Σ_(i=1)^n (1/2)(Δθ)(f(θᵢ))²

We take the limit as n→∞ to get the exact area:

A = limₙ→∞ Aₙ = (1/2)∫αβ (f(θ))²dθ.

This gives the following theorem.

### Theorem 7.6

### Area of aRegionBounded byaPolar Curve

Suppose $f$ is continuous and nonnegative on the interval α ≤ θ ≤ β with 0<β-α≤2π The area of the regior bounded by the graph of r = f(θ) between the radial lines θ = α and θ=β is

A=(1/2)∫αβ[f(θ)]²dθ=(1/2)∫αβr²dθ

### EXAMPLE 7.16

## Finding an Areaof a Polar Region

Find the area of one petal of the rose defined by the equation $r=3$ sin (20).

![](./images/fiACIHGxgByYViFqu0zq3df1IM735BLOP.png)

The graph of $r=3$ sin (20) follows.

![](./images/fSBTbxVFm709YuV2viMoyOIlgqpir3vhp.png)
Figure 7.41 The graph of $r=3$ r = 3 r = 3sin(2θ)

When θ=0 we have $r=3$ sir 1(2(0))=0. The next value for which $r=0$ is θ=π/2 This can be seen by solving the equation 3 sin(2θ) = 0 for θ Therefore the values θ=0 to θ=π/2 trace out the first petal of the rose. To find the area inside this petal, use Equation Z.9 with f(θ)=3 sin (20), α = 0 ,and β = π/2

A = (1/2)∫αβ[f(θ)]²dθ = (1/2)∫₀^(π/2)[3sin(2θ)]²dθ = (1/2)∫₀^(π/2)9sin²(2θ)dθ

To evaluate this integral, use the formula sin²α = (1 cos(2α))/2 with α = 2θ

A = (1/2)∫₀^π/² 9sin²(2θ)dθ = (9/2)∫₀^π/² (1-cos(4θ))/2 dθ = (9/4)(∫₀^π/² 1-cos(4θ)dθ) = (9/4)(θ - sin(4θ)/4)|₀^π/² = (9/4)(π/2 - sin(2π)/4) - (9/4)(0 - sin(0)/4) = 9π/8.

7.15 Find the area inside the cardioid defined by the equation r=1-cosθ

Example Z.16 involved finding the area inside one curve. We can also use Area of a Reqion Bounded by a Polar Curve to find the area between two polar curves. However, we often need to find the points of intersection of the curves and determine which function defines the outer curve or the inner curve between these two points

### EXAMPLE 7.17

### Finding the Area between Two Polar Curves

Find the area outside the cardioid $r=2+2$ sin 0 and inside the circle r = 6sinθ

![](./images/f9z4hZRVahkaKElxfwLiw2vdeWI0gM00t.png)

First draw a graph containing both curves as shown

## Solution

![](./images/fg5FVXLs4G0gCT4TcdISw8iiHgygwGsGy.png)
Figure 7.42 The region between the curves. r = 2 + 2sinθ and r = 6sinθ

To determine the limits of integration,first find the points of intersection by setting the two functions equal to each other and solving for θ

6sinθ = 2 + 2sinθ; 4sinθ = 2; sinθ = 1/2

This gives the solutions θ = and θ =, which are the limits of integration. The circle r =3 $r=3$ r=3sinθ 0 θ is the red graph which is the outer function, and the cardioid r = 2 + 2sinθ is the blue graph, which is the inner function.To calculate the area between the curves, start with the area inside the circle between θ=π/6 and θ=5π/6 ,then subtract the area inside the cardioid between θ=π/6 and θ=5π/6

A = circle-cardioid = 1/2∫(π/6)^(5π/6)[6sinθ]²dθ - 1/2∫(π/6)^(5π/6)[2+2sinθ]²dθ = 1/2∫(π/6)^(5π/6)36sin²θdθ - 1/2∫(π/6)^(5π/6)[4+8sinθ+4sin²θ]dθ = 18∫(π/6)^(5π/6)(1-cos(2θ))/2dθ - 2∫(π/6)^(5π/6)[1+2sinθ+(1-cos(2θ))/2]dθ = 9[θ-sin(2θ)/2](π/6)^(5π/6) - 2[3θ/2-2cosθ-sin(2θ)/4](π/6)^(5π/6) = 9(5π/6-sin(5π/3)/2)-9(π/6-sin(π/3)/2) - (5π/2-4cos(5π/6)-sin(5π/3)/2)+(π/2-4cos(π/6)-sin(π/3)/2) = 4π.

Find the area inside the circle $r=4$ cos θ and outside the circle $r=2$

In Example Z.17we found the area inside the circle and outside the cardioid by first finding theirintersection points Notice that solving the equation directly for θ yielded two solutions: θ=π/6 and θ=5π/6 .However, in the graph there are three intersection points. The third intersection point is the origin. The reason why this point did not show up as a solution isbecause the origin is on bothgraphsbut for different values of θ .For example, for the cardioid we get

2+2sinθ=0, sinθ=-1

so the values for θ that solve this equation are θ=3π/2+2nπ ,where $m$ is any integer. For the circle we get

6sinθ = 0

The solutions to this equation are of the form θ = nπ for any integer value of $n$ These two solution sets have no points in common. Reqardless of this fact, the curves intersect at the oriqin. This case must always be taken into consideration

## Arc Lenqth in Polar Curves

Here we derive a formula for the arc length of a curve defined in polar coordinates.

In rectangular coordinates, the arc length of a parameterized curve (x(t), y(t)) for 
a ≤ t ≤ b is given b

L=∫ₐᵇ√((dx/dt)²+(dy/dt)²)dt

Inpolar coordinateswe define the curve by the equation r = f(θ) ,where α ≤ θ ≤ β In order to adapt the arc length formula for a polar curve, we use the equations

x = rcosθ = f(θ)cosθ and y = rsinθ = f(θ)sinθ

and we replace the parameter t by θ .Then

dx/dθ = f'(θ)cosθ - f(θ)sinθ, dy/dθ = f'(θ)sinθ + f(θ)cosθ

We replace dt by dθ , and the lower and upper limits of integration are 
α and  β  , respectively. Then the arc length formula becomes

L = ∫ₐᵇ√((dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)²)dt = ∫αβ√((dx/dθ)² + (dy/dθ)²)dθ = ∫αβ√((f'(θ)cosθ - f(θ)sinθ)² + (f'(θ)sinθ + f(θ)cosθ)²)dθ = ∫αβ√((f'(θ))²(cos²θ + sin²θ) + (f(θ))²(cos²θ + sin²θ))dθ = ∫αβ√((f'(θ))² + (f(θ))²)dθ = ∫αβ√(r² + (dr/dθ)²)dθ

This gives us the following theorem.

## Theorem 7.7

## Arc Length of a Curve Defined by aPolarFunction

Let $f$ be a function whose derivative is continuous on an interval α ≤ θ ≤ β The length of the graph of r = f(θ) from θ = α to θ=β is

L = ∫_α^β√([f(θ)]² + [f'(θ)]²)dθ = ∫_α^β√(r² + (dr/dθ)²)dθ 

EXAMPLE 7.18

### Finding the Arc Length of a Polar Curve

Find the arc length of the cardioid r = 2 + 2cosθ

## $②$ Solution

When θ=0, r=2+2cos0=4 . Furthermore, as θ goes from0 to 2π the cardioid is traced out exactly once.Therefore these are the limits of integration. Using f(θ)=2+2cosθ α = 0 , and β=2π Equation 7.10 becomes

L =∫αβ√[f(θ)]²+[f'(θ)]²dθ =∫₀²π√[2+2cosθ]²+[-2sinθ]²dθ =∫₀²π√4+8cosθ+4cos²θ+4sin²θdθ =∫₀²π√4+8cosθ+4(cos²θ+sin²θ)dθ =∫₀²π√8+8cosθdθ =2∫₀²π√2+2cosθdθ.

Next, using the identity cos (2α)=2cos²α−1 ,add 1 to both sides and multiply by 2. This gives 2+2cos(2α)=4cos²α Substituting α=θ/2 gives 2 + 2cosθ = 4cos²(θ/2) ,so the integral becomes


L = 2∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup>√(2+2cosθ)dθ = 2∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup>√(4cos²(θ/2))dθ = 2∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup>2|cos(θ/2)|dθ

The absolute value is necessary because the cosine is negative for some values in its domain. To resolve this issue change the limits from 0 to π and double the answer. This strategy works because cosine is positive between O and Thus,

L = 4∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup>|cos(θ/2)|dθ = 8∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>cos(θ/2)dθ = 8(2sin(θ/2))<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup> = 16

# 7.5 Conic Sections

## Learning Objectives

7.5.1Identify the equation of a parabola in standard form with given focus and directrix 7.5.2 Identify the equation of an ellipse in standard form with given foci 7.5.3Identify the equation of a hyperbola in standard form with given foci 7.5.4 Recognize a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola from its eccentricity value. 7.5.5 Write the polar equation of a conic section with eccentricity e 7.5.6 Identify when a general equation of degree two is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola

Conic sections have been studied since the time of the ancient Greeks, and were considered to be an important mathematical concept. As early as 320 BCE, such Greek mathematicians as Menaechmus, Appollonius, and Archimedes were fascinated by these curves. Appollonius wrote an entire eight-volume treatise on conic sections in which he was, for example, able to derive a specific method for identifying a conic section through the use of geometry. Since then, important applications of conic sections have arisen (for example, in astronomy), and the properties of conic sections are used in radio telescopes, satellite dish receivers, and even architecture. In this section we discuss the three basic conic sections, some of their properties, and their equations.

Conic sections get their name because they can be generated by intersecting a plane with a cone. A cone has two identically shaped parts called nappes. One nappe is what most people mean by "cone,* having the shape of a party hat

Ariaht circular cone can be generated by revolving aline passing throuah the oriain around the yaxis as shown

![](./images/f0geG6N7cCozUOaF7PQ5PWo8ofDmd2zHV.png)
Figure 7.43 A cone generated by revolving the line $y=3x$ around the y-axis

Conic sections are generated by the intersection of a plane with a cone (Eigure 7.44). If the plane intersects both nappes, then the conic section is a hyperbola.If the plane is parallel to the generating line, the conic section is a parabola.If the plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the conic section is a circle.If the plane intersects one nappe at an angle to the axis (other than 90° ), then the conic section is an ellipse..

## Parabolas

Aparabola is generated when a plane intersects a cone parallel to the generating line.In this case, the plane intersects only one of the nappes.Aparabola can alsobe defined in terms of distances

### Definition

Aparabola is the set ofallpoints whosedistance from a fixedpoint,called the focus.is eaualtothe distance from fixed line, called the directrix. The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is called the vertex of the parabola

A qraph of a typical parabola appears in Fiqure 7.45. Using this diagram in conjunction with the distance formula,we can derive an equation for a parabola. Recall the distance formula: Given point $P$ with coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$ and point Q with coordinates (x₂, y₂), the distance between them is given by the formula

d(P,Q) = √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²) 

Then from the definition of a parabola and Figure 7.45, we get

d(F, P) = d(P, Q); √((0 - x)² + (p - y)²) = √((x - x)² + (-p - y)²).

Squaring both sides and simplifying yields

![](./images/fuuBObBIqQZWzS8zDgzMgo9IsugQQm9Gu.png)
Figure 7.45 A typical parabola in which the distance from the focus to the vertex is represented by the variable $p$

Now suppose we want to relocate the vertex. We use the variables $(h,k)$ to denote the coordinates of the vertex.Then if the focus is directly above the vertex, it has coordinates $(h,k+p)$ and the directrix has the equation $y=k-p$ .Going through the same derivation yields the formula $(x-h)^{2}=4p(y-k)$ . Solving this equation for y leads to the following theorem.

## Theorem 7.8

### Equations for Parabolas

Given a parabola opening upward withvertex located at $(h,k)$ and focus located at $(h,k+p)$ , where p is a constant, the equation for the parabola is given by

y=(1/4p)(x-h)²+k

This is the standard form of a parabola

We can also study the cases when the parabola opens down or to the left or the right.The equation for each of these cases can also be written in standard form as shown in the following graphs.

![](./images/fXtDrFEO3gEssZUm4b1dHheZ0BXGWCKVZ.png)
Figure 7.46 Four parabolas, opening in various directions, along with their equations in standard form.

In addition, the equation of a parabola can be written in the general form, though in this form the values of h<sub>μ</sub> k,and $p$ are not immediately recognizable. The general form of a parabola is written as

ax²+bx+cy+d=0 or ay²+bx+cy+d=0.

The first equation represents a parabola thatopens either up or down.The second equationrepresents a parabola that opens either to the left or to the right. To put the equation into standard form, use the method of completing the square.

### EXAMPLE7.19

Converting the Equation of a Parabola from General into Standard Form

Put the equation $x^{2}-4x-8y+12=0$ into standard form and graph the resulting parabola

## $②$ Solution

Since yis not squared in this equation, we know that the parabola opens either upward or downward. Therefore we need to solve this equation for $y$, which will put the equation into standard form. To do that, first add $8y$ to both sides of the equation:

$$8y=x^{2}-4x+12.$$

The next step is to complete the square on the right-hand side. Start by grouping the first two terms on the right-hand side using parentheses:

8y=(x²-4x)+12

Next determine the constant that, when added inside the parentheses, makes the quantity inside the parentheses a perfect square trinomial. To do this, take half the coefficient of $x$ and square it. This gives (-4/2)² = 4 Add 4 inside the parentheses and subtract 4 outside the parentheses. so the yalue of the eauation is not changed

8y=(x²-4x+4)+12-4

Nowcombine like terms and factor the quantity inside theparentheses

$$8y=(x-2)^{2}+8.$$

Finally, divide by 8:


y=(1/8)(x-2)²+1

This equation is now in standard form. Comparing this to Equation 7.11 gives $h=2$ $k=1$ , and $p=2$ . The parabola opens up, with vertex at (2,1) ,focus at (2,3) , and directrix $y=-1$ . The graph of this parabola appears as follows.

![](./images/f9S2RHU57GTNnYdTscKRKKblp1ypys9my.png)
Figure 7.47 The parabola in Example 7.19

7.18 Put the equation $2y^{2}-x+12y+16=0$ into standard form and graph the resulting parabola

The axis of symmetry of a vertical (opening up or down) parabola is a vertical line passing through the vertex. The parabola has an interesting reflective property. Suppose we have a satellite dish with a parabolic cross section. If a beam of electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves, comes into the dish in a straight line from a satellite (parallel to the axis of symmetry), then the waves reflect off the dish and collect at the focus of the parabola as shown

![](./images/fHebXB7Gn8cYAcNxcwcCChGWEm6mLU7o7.png)

Consider a parabolic dish designed to collect signals from a satellite in space. The dish is aimed directly at the satellite and a receiver is located at the focus of the parabola.Radio waves coming in from the satellite are reflected off the surface of the parabola to the receiver, which collects and decodes the digital signals.This allows a small receiver to gather signals from a wide angle of sky.Flashlights and headlights in a car work on the same principle,but in reverse the source of the light (that is, the light bulb) is located at the focus and the reflecting surface on the parabolic mirror focuses the beam straight ahead. This allows a small light bulb to illuminate a wide angle of space in front of the flashlight or car.

# Ellipses

An ellipse can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of an ellipse, there are two foci (plural of focus), and two directrices(plural of directrix).We look at the directrices inmore detail later in thissection.

### Definition

An ellipse is the set of all points for which the sum of their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant.

![](./images/f5WtPsXn9auuxlfWG5rQdB7ZawCSfnNBP.png)
Figure 7.48 A typical ellipse in which the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant.

A graph of a typical ellipse is shown in Eiqure Z.48. In this figure the foci are labeled as $F$ and F' .Both are the same fixed distance from the origin, and this distance is represented by the variable c. Therefore the coordinates of $F$ are $(c,0)$ and the coordinates of F' are $(-c,0).$ The points $P$ and P' are located at the ends of the major axis of the ellipse, and have coordinates $(a,0)$ and $(-a,0)$, respectively. The major axis is always the longest distance across the ellipse, and can be

horizontal or vertical. Thus, thelength of the major axis in this ellipse is 2a.Furthermore, $P$ and P' are called the vertices of the ellipse. The points $Q$ and Q' are located at the ends of the minor axis of the ellipse, and have coordinates $(0,b)$ and $(0,-b)$ , respectively. The minor axis is the shortest distance across the ellipse. The minor axis is perpendicular to the major axis.

According to the definition of the ellipse, we can choose any point on the ellipse and the sum of the distances from this point to the two foci is constant. Suppose we choose the point $P.$ Since the coordinates of point $P$ are $(a,0)$ , the sum of the distances is

d(P,F)+d(P,F')=(a-c)+(a+c)=2a

Therefore the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point A with coordinates $(x,y)$ is also equal to 2a. Using the distance formula, we get

d(A,F)+d(A,F')=2a√((x-c)²+y²)+√((x+c)²+y²)=2a

Subtract the second radical from both sides and square both sides
√((x-c)²+y²) = 2a-√((x+c)²+y²)
(x-c)²+y² = 4a²-4a√((x+c)²+y²)+(x+c)²+y²
x²-2cx+c²+y² = 4a²-4a√((x+c)²+y²)+x²+2cx+c²+y²
-2cx = 4a²-4a√((x+c)²+y²)+2cx.

Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:

-2cx = 4a² - 4a√((x+c)²+y²) + 2cx
4a√((x+c)²+y²) = 4a² + 4cx
√((x+c)²+y²) = a + cx/a
(x+c)² + y² = a² + 2cx + c²x²/a²
x² + 2cx + c² + y² = a² + 2cx + c²x²/a²
x² + c² + y² = a² + c²x²/a²

Isolate the variables on the left-hand side of the eauation and the constants on the riaht-hand side

x² - c²x²/a² + y² = a² - c², ((a²-c²)x²)/a² + y² = a² - c²

Divide both sides by $a^{2}-c^{2}.$ This gives the equatior

x²/a² + y²/(a²-c²) = 1.

If we refer back to Figure 7.48, then the length of each of the two green line segments is equal to a. This is true because the sum of the distances from the point $Q$ to the foci $F$ and F' is equal to 2a, and the lengths of these two line segments are equal. This line segment forms a right triangle with hypotenuse length a and leg lengths b and c. From the Pythagorean theorem,e $a^{2}=b^{2}=c^{2}$ and $b^{2}+a^{2}-c^{2}$ Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes

x²/a² + y²/b² = 1

Finally, if the center of the ellipse is moved from the origin to a point $(h,k)$ , we have the following standard form of an ellipse.

### Theorem 7.9

### Equation of anEllipse in StandardForm

Consider the ellipse with center $( h, k)$ , a horizontal major axiswith length2a,and a vertical minor axiswith length 2b Then the equation ofthisellipse instandard form is

(x-h)²/a² + (y-k)²/b² = 1

and the foci are located at (h±c,k) , where $c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}$ The equations of the directrices are x = h ± 

If the maior axis js vertical, then the eauation of the ellipse becomes

(x-h)²/b²+(y-k)²/a²=1

and the foci are located at (h, k ± c) , where $c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}.$ The equations of the directrices in this case are y =k±

If the major axis is horizontal, then the ellipse is called horizontal, and if the major axis is vertical, then the ellipse is called vertical. The equation of an ellipse is in general form if it is in the form $Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cx+Dy+E=0$ whereA and B are either both positive or both neqative.To convert the equation from qeneralto standard form,use the methoc of completing the square

## EXAMPLE 7.20

### Finding the Standard Form of an Ellipse

 Put the equation $9x^{2}+4y^{2}-36x+24y+36=0$ into standard form and graph the resulting ellipse.

## $②$ Solution

First subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:

$$9x^{2}+4y^{2}-36x+24y=-36.$$

Next group the $x$ terms together and the yterms together, and factor out the common factor

(9x²-36x)+(4y²+24y)=-36

We need to determine the constant that, when added inside each set of parentheses, results in a perfect square. In the first set of parentheses, take half the coefficient of x and square it. This gives (-4/2)²=4 In the second set o parentheses, take half the coeffcient of y and square it.Thisgives (6/2)²=9 Add these inside each pair of parentheses. Since the first set of parentheses has a 9 in front, we are actually adding 36 to the left-hand side. Similarly, we are adding 36 to the second set as well. Therefore the equation becomes

9(x² - 4x + 4) + 4(y² + 6y + 9) = 36

Now factor both sets of parentheses and divide by 36

9(x-2)²+4(y+3)²=36, 9(x-2)²/36+4(y+3)²/36=1, (x-2)²/4+(y+3)²/9=1

The equation is now in standard form.Comparing this toEquation 7.14 gives $h=2$ $k=-3$ $a=3$ ,and $b=2$ . This is a vertical ellipse with center at (2,-3) , major axis 6, and minor axis 4. The graph of this ellipse appears as follows.

![](./images/fGVewb4RwkxEIpnSR5ZcRsp0I7QgMPuaO.png)

7.19 Put the equation $9x^2+16y^2+18x-64y-71=0$ into standard form and graph the resulting ellipse.

According to Kepler's first law of planetary motion, the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci as shown in Eigure Z.5Q(a). Because Earth's orbit is an ellipse, the distance from the Sun varies throughout the year. A commonly held misconception is that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer. In fact, in summer for the northern hemisphere, Earth is farther from the Sun than during winter. The difference in season is caused by the tilt of Earth's axis in the orbital plane. Comets that orbit the Sun, such as Halley's Comet, also have elliptical orbits, as do moons orbiting the planets and satellites orbiting Earth.

Ellipses also have interesting reflective properties: A light ray emanating from one focus passes through the other focus after mirror reflection in the ellipse. The same thing occurs with a sound wave as well. The National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, is a famous room in an elliptical shape as shown in Figure 7.50(b). This hall served as the meeting place for the U.S. House of Representatives for almost fifty years. The location of the two foci of this semielliptical room are clearly identified by marks on the floor, and even if the room is full of visitors, when two people stand on these spots and speak to each other, they can hear each other much more clearly than they can hear someone standing close by. Legend has it that John Quincy Adams had his desk located on one of the foci and was able to eavesdrop on everyone else in the House without ever needing to stand. Although this makes a good story, it is unlikely to be true, because the original ceiling produced so many echoes that the entire room had to be hung with carpets to dampen the noise. The ceiling was rebuilt in 1902 and only then did the now-famous whispering effect emerge. Another famous whispering gallery—the site of many marriage proposals—is in Grand Central Station in New York City

Figure 7.50 (a) Earth's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. (b) Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol is a whispering gallery with an elliptical cross section.

# Hyperbolas

A hyperbola can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of a hyperbola, there are two foci and two directrices Hyperbolas also have two asymptotes.

### Definition

A hyperbola is the set of all points where the difference between their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant

A graph of a typical hyperbola appears as follows.

![](./images/fTGKqYh0aEDgAaxpozwwKhBLE5mGaUmL3.png)
Figure 7.51 A typical hyperbola in which the difference of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is

constant. The transverse axis is also called the major axis, and the conjugate axis is also called the minor axis.

The derivation of the equation of a hyperbola in standard form is virtually identical to that of an ellipse. One slight hitch lies in the definition: The difference between two numbers is always positive. Let $P$ be a point on the hyperbola with coordinates $(x,y)$ . Then the definition of the hyperbola gives |d |d(P,F₁) - d(P,F₂)| = constant. To simplify the derivation, assume that $P$ is on the right branch of the hyperbola,so the absolute value bars drop. If it is on the left branch, then the subtraction is reversed. The vertex of the right branch has coordinates $(a,0)$ ,SC

d(P,F₁) - d(P,F₂) = (c+a) - (c-a) = 2a

This equation is therefore true for any point on the hyperbola. Returning to the coordinates $(x,y)$ for P:

d(P,F₁) - d(P,F₂) = 2a, √((x+c)² + y²) - √((x-c)² + y²) = 2a

Add the second radical from both sides and square both sides:
√((x-c)²+y²) = 2a+√((x+c)²+y²), (x-c)²+y² = 4a²+4a√((x+c)²+y²)+(x+c)²+y², x²-2cx+c²+y² = 4a²+4a√((x+c)²+y²)+x²+2cx+c²+y², -2cx = 4a²+4a√((x+c)²+y²)+2cx

Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:

-2cx = 4a² + 4a√((x+c)²+y²) + 2cx, 4a√((x+c)²+y²) = -4a² - 4cx, √((x+c)²+y²) = -a - cx/a, (x+c)²+y² = a² + 2cx + c²x²/a², x² + 2cx + c² + y² = a² + 2cx + c²x²/a², x² + c² + y² = a² + c²x²/a².

Isolate the variables on the left-hand side of the equation and the constants on the right-hand side:

x² - c²x²/a² + y² = a² - c², ((a²-c²)x²)/a² + y² = a² - c²

Finally, divide both sides by $a^{2}-c^{2}$ .This gives the equation

x²/a² + y²/(a²-c²) = 1.

We now definebso that $b^{2}=c^{2}-a^{2}$ . This is possible because. $c>a$ . Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes.

x²/a²-y²/b²=1.

Finally, if the center of the hyperbola is moved from the origin to the point $(h,k)$ , we have the following standard form of a hyperbola.

## Theorem 7.10

## Equation of a Hyperbola in Standard Form

Consider the hyperbola with center $(h,k)$ , a horizontal major axis, and a vertical minor axis. Then the equation of this ellipse is

 (x-h)²/a² - (y-k)²/b² = 1

and the foci are located at (h±c,k), where $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.$ The equations of the asymptotes are given by y=k±b/a(x-h) The equations of the directrices are

x = h ± a²/√(a²+b²) = h ± a²/c

 If the major axis is vertical, then the equation of the hyperbola becomes

(y-k)²/a²-(x-h)²/b²=1

and the foci are located at (h, k ± c) ,where $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.$ The equations of the asymptotes are given by y=k±a/b(x-h) The equations of the directrices are

y=k±a²/√(a²+b²)=k±a²/c

If the maior axis (transverse axis)is horizontal.then the hvnerbola is called horizontal.and if the maior axis is vertica then the hyperbola is called vertical. The equation of a hyperbola is in general form if it is in the form $Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cx+Dy+E=0$ where Aand $B$ have opposite signs.In order to convert the equation from general to standard form,use the method of completing the square.

## EXAMPLE 7.21

## Finding the Standard Form of a Hyperbola Put the equation $9x^{2}-16y^{2}+36x+32y-124=0$ into standard form and graph the resulting hyperbola.What are

the equations of the asymptotes

## $(O)$ Solution

First add 124 to both sides of the equation

$$9x^2-16y^2+36x+32y=124.$$

Next group the $x$ terms together and the yterms together then factor out the common factors:

(9x²+36x)-(16y²-32y)=124, 9(x²+4x)-16(y²-2y)=124

We need to determine the constant that,when added inside each set ofparentheses,results in a perfect square.In the first set of parentheses, take half the coefficient of $X$ and square it. This gives () = 4. In the second set of parentheses, take halfthe coefficient o y and square it.Thisgives (-2/2)² = 1 .Ad these inside each pair of parentheses. Since the first set of parentheses has a 9 in front, we are actually adding 36 to the left-hand side. Similarly we are subtracting 16 from the second set of parentheses. Therefore the equation becomes

9(x²+4x+4)-16(y²-2y+1)=144

Next factor both sets of parentheses and divide by 144

9(x+2)² - 16(y-1)² = 144; 9(x+2)²/144 - 16(y-1)²/144 = 1; (x+2)²/16 - (y-1)²/9 = 1.

The equation is now in standard form. Comparing this to Equation 7.15 gives h =-2 $h=-2$ $h=-2,k=1,a=4$, k = 1 $k=1$ $a=4$ α = 4 and $b=3$ This is a horizontal hyperbola with center at (-2,1) and asymptotes given by the equations  y=1±3/4(x+2)  . The graph of this hyperbola appears in the following figure

![](./images/f05YtSdzw4kC050fqEIwluyblwgRx7xwh.png)
Figure 7.52 Graph of the hyperbola in Example 7.21.

Hyperbolas also have interesting reflective properties. A ray directed toward one focus of a hyperbola is reflected by a hyperbolic mirror toward the other focus. This concept is illustrated in the following figure.

![](./images/fglt1gCbGPqfy1tF5a8GmXCGn9oEKd2AP.png)
Figure 7.53 A hyperbolic mirror used to collect light from distant stars.

This property of the hyperbola has important applications. It is used in radio direction finding (since the difference in signals from two towers is constant along hyperbolas), and in the construction of mirrors inside telescopes (to reflect light coming from the parabolic mirror to the eyepiece). Another interesting fact about hyperbolas is that for a comet entering the solar system, if the speed is great enough to escape the Sun's gravitational pull, then the path that the comet takes as it passes through the solar system is hyperbolic.

# Eccentricity and Directrix

An alternative way to describe a conic section involves the directrices, the foci, and a new property called eccentricity. We will see that the value of the eccentricity of a conic section can uniquely define that conic.

### Definition

The eccentricity e of a conic section is defined to be the distance from any point on the conic section to its focus divided by the perpendicular distance from that point to the nearest directrix. This value is constant for any conic section, and can define the conic section as well:

1.If $e=1$ ,the conic is a parabola. 2.If $e<1$ , it is an ellipse. 3.If $e>1$ ,it is a hyperbola

The eccentricity of a circle is zero. The directrix of a conic section is the line that, together with the point known as the focus, serves to define a conic section. Hyperbolas and noncircular ellipses have two foci and two associated directrices.Parabolas have one focus and one directrix.

The three conicsections with their directrices appearin the following figure

![](./images/fhFT54qI4lArsuF6XCUXhdl5ysZZ9dgSG.png)
Figure 7.54 The three conic sections with their foci and directrices.

Recall from the definition of a parabola that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that same point to the directrix.Therefore, by definition, the eccentricity of a parabola must be 1. The equations of the directrices of a horizontal ellipse are x = ±a²/c .The right vertex of the ellipse is located at $(a,0)$ and the right focus is $(c,0)$ Therefore the distance from the vertex to the focus is $a-c$ and the distance from the vertex to the right directrix is a²/c-a .This gives the eccentricityas

e=(a-c)/(a²/c-a)=c(a-c)/(a²-ac)=c(a-c)/a(a-c)=c/a.

Since $c<a$ , this step proves that the eccentricity of an ellipse is less than 1. The directrices of a horizontal hyperbola are also located at x = ±a²/c , and a similar calculation shows that the eccentricity of a hyperbola is also e = c/a However ir this case we have $c>a$ ,so the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1

### EXAMPLE 7.22

### Determining Eccentricity of a Conic Section

Determine the eccentricity of the ellipse described by the equation

(x-3)²/16+(y+2)²/25=1

### $②$ Solution

From the equation we see that $a=5$ and $b=4.$ The value of $c$ can be calculated using the equation $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}$ for an ellipse.Substituting the values of a and $b$ and solving for $c$ qives $c=3$ Therefore the eccentricity of the ellipseis 
e = c/a = 3/5 = 0.6

7.21 Determine theeccentricity of the hyperbola described by the equation

(y-3)²/49 - (x+2)²/25 = 1 

### Polar Equations of Conic Sections

Sometimes it is useful to write or identify the equation of a conic section in polar form.To do this, we need the concept of the focal parameter. The focal parameter of a conic section  β  is defined as the distance from a focus to the nearest directrix. The following table gives the focal parameters for the different types of conics, where a is the length of the semi-major axis (i.e., half the length of the major axis), c is the distance from the origin to the focus, and e is the

eccentricity.In the case of a parabola,a represents the distance from the vertex to the focus



Conic|e| |$p$
Ellipse|$0<e<$ 7| $a^2-c^2$|$1-e^{2}$
Parabola|1 ρ= |$2a$| 
Hyperbola|1 $e>$ 1 ,|c²-a² $C$|$a(e^2-1$ = $e$

Table 7.1 Eccentricities and Focal Parameters of the Conic Sections

Using the definitions of the focal parameter and eccentricity of the conic section, we can derive an equation for any conic section in polar coordinates. In particular, we assume that one of the foci of a given conic section lies at the pole. Then using the definition of the various conic sections in terms of distances, it is possible to prove the following theorem

### Theorem 7.11

### Polar Equation of Conic Sections

The polar equation of a conic section with focal parameter $p$ is given by

r = ep/(1±e cosθ) or r = ep/(1±e sinθ)

In the equation on the left, the major axis of the conic section is horizontal,and in the equation on the right, the major axis is vertical. To work with a conic section written in polar form, first make the constant term in the denominator equal to 1. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the constant that appears in front of the plus or minus in the denominator. Then the coefficient of the sine or cosine in the denominator is the eccentricity. This value identifies the conic. If cosine appears in the denominator, then the conic is horizontal. If sine appears, then the conic is vertical. If both appear then the axes are rotated. The center of the conic is not necessarily at the origin. The center is at the origin only if the conic is a circle (i.e., $e=0$

# EXAMPLE 7.23

### Graphing a Conic Section in Polar Coordinates

Identify and create a graph of the conic section described by the equation

r=3/(1+2cosθ)

## $①$ Solution

The constant term in the denominator is 1, so the eccentricity of the conic is 2. This is a hyperbola. The focal parameter ρ can be calculated by using the equation $ep=3.$ Since $e=2$ , this gives p=3/2 .The cosine function appears in the denominator, so the hyperbola is horizontal. Pick a few values for θ and create a table of values. Then we can graph the hyperbola (Figure 7.55).

Identify and create a graph of the conic section described by the equation

r = 4/(1 - 0.8sinθ)

## General Equations of Degree Two

A general equation of degree two can be written in the form

$$Ax^{2}+Bxy+Cy^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0.$$

The graph of an equation of this form is a conic section. If 
B ≠ 0 then the coordinate axes are rotated. To identify the conic section, we use the discriminant of the conic section $4AC-B^{2}$ . One of the following cases must be true:

1. $4AC-B^{2}>0$ If so, the graph is an ellipse. 2. $4AC-B^{2}=0$ If so, the graph is a parabola. 3. $4AC-B^{2}<0$ If so, the graph is a hyperbola

The simplest example of a second-degree equation involving a cross term is $xy=1$ This equation can be solved for yto obtain y=1/x .The graph of this function is called a rectangular hyperbola as shown.

![](./images/f3pFzb9yUQdineKH0LdYRRkewghUTXOP2.png)
Figure 7.56 Graph of the equation $xy=1;$ The red lines indicate the rotated axes.

The asymptotes of this hyperbola are the $x$ and ycoordinate axes. To determine the angle. θ of rotation of the conic section, we use the formula cot 2θ = (A-C)/B In this case $A=C=0$ and $B=1$ ,So cot 2θ=(0-0)/1=0 and θ = 45° The method for graphing a conic section with rotated axes involves determining the coefficients of the conic in the rotated coordinate system. The new coefficients are labeled A',B',C',D',E' ,and F' ,and are given by the formulas

A' = Acos²θ+Bcosθsinθ+Csin²θ, B' = 0, C' = Asin²θ-Bsinθcosθ+Ccos²θ, D' = Dcosθ+Esinθ, E' = -Dsinθ+Ecosθ, F' = F

The procedure for graphing a rotated conic is the following:

1.Identify the conic section using the discriminant $4AC-B^{2}$ 2.Determine θ using the formula cot 2θ = (A-C)/B 3.Calculate A' A' A',B',C',D',E' , and F' 4.Rewrite the original equation using A',B',C',D',E' ,and F' 5.Draw a graph using the rotated equation.

### EXAMPLE 7.24

### Identifying a Rotated Conic

Identify the conic and calculate the angle of rotation of axes for the curve described by the equation

13x² - 6√3xy + 7y² - 256 = 0.

### $②$ Solution

In this equation, $A=13$ B=-6√3, C=7, D=0, E=0 $E=0$ E=0 , and $F=-256$ .The discriminant of this equation is 4AC-B²=4(13)(7)-(-6√3)²=364-108=256 Therefore thisconic isan elipse. T calculatethe angle of rotation of the axes,usecot 2θ = (A-C)/B This gives

cot2θ = (A-C)/B = (13-7)/(-6√3) = -√3/3

Therefore 2θ = 120⁰ and θ = 60° ,which is the angle of the rotation of the axes.

To determine the rotated coefficients,use the formulas given above:

A' = Acos²θ + Bcosθsinθ + Csin²θ = 13cos²60 + (-6√3)cos60sin60 + 7sin²60 = 13(1/2)² - 6√3(1/2)(√3/2) + 7(√3/2)² = 4,
B' = 0,
C' = Asin²θ - Bsinθcosθ + Ccos²θ = 13sin²60 + (-6√3)sin60cos60 + 7cos²60 = 13(√3/2)² - 6√3(√3/2)(1/2) + 7(1/2)² = 16,
D' = Dcosθ + Esinθ = (0)cos60 + (0)sin60 = 0
7 Ξ' = -Dsinθ + Ecosθ = -(0)sin60 + (0)cos60 = 0,
F' = F = -256.

The equation of the conic in the rotated coordinate system becomes

4(x')² + 16(y')² = 256; (x')²/64 + (y')²/16 = 1

A graph of this conic section appears as follows.

## Key Concepts

### 7.1 Parametric Equations

·Parametric equations provide a convenient way to describe a curve.A parameter can represent time or some other meaningful quantity. ·It isoften possible toeliminate the parameterin a parameterized curve to obtain a function orrelation describind

that curve. There is always more than one way to parameterize a curve.

·Parametric equations can describe complicated curves that are difficult or perhaps impossible to describe using rectangular coordinates.

### 7.2 Calculus of Parametric Curves

·The derivative of the parametrically defined curve x = x(t) and $y=y(t)$ can be calculated using the formula dy/dx = y'(t)/x'(t). Using the derivativ, we can find the equation of a tangent ine to a parametric curve ·The area between a parametric curve and the x-axis can be determined by using the formula

A=∫ₜ₁ₜ₂y(t)x'(t)dt.

The polar coordinate system provides an alternative way to locate points in the plane. Convert points between rectangular and polar coordinates using the formulas

x=r cos θ θ and y=rsinθ

and

r = √(x² + y²) and tanθ = y/x

·To sketch a polar curve from a given polar function, make a table of values and take advantage of periodic properties. ·Use the conversion formulas to convert equations between rectanqular and polar coordinates.

Identify symmetry in polar curves, which can occur throuqh the pole, the horizontal axis, or the vertical axis

The following is a list of the following:

* **Data Structures:**  The data structures used to store and manipulate the data.  This includes arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, etc.  The choice of data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of your algorithm.

* **Algorithms:** The algorithms used to process and manipulate the data.  This includes sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph traversal algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.

* **Programming Language:** The choice of programming language will affect the efficiency and readability of your code.  Python is a good choice for its readability and extensive libraries, but other languages like C++ or Java might be more efficient for performance-critical sections.

* **Hardware:** The hardware you're running on will influence the performance.  A faster processor or more memory will allow for faster execution.

* **Input Size:** The size of the input data (number of nodes and edges) will significantly impact the runtime.  A naive algorithm might be fine for small graphs, but a more sophisticated algorithm might be necessary for large graphs.

* **Implementation Details:**  The specific implementation of the algorithm (e.g., using optimized libraries, efficient data structures) can greatly affect performance.

Let's analyze the provided code and consider improvements.

The provided code has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops.  This is because for each node, it iterates through all other nodes to check for connectivity.  This is inefficient for large graphs.

Here's a more efficient approach using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which would have a time complexity closer to O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  This is a significant improvement over O(n^2) for large graphs.

Here's a Python implementation using Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list:

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    """
    Finds the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary representing the graph where keys are nodes and values are lists of their neighbors.
        start: The starting node.
        end: The destination node.

    Returns:
        A list representing the shortest path from start to end, or None if no path exists.
    """

    queue = [(start, [start])]  # Queue of (node, path) pairs
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        (vertex, path) = queue.pop(0)  # Dequeue FIFO

        if vertex == end:
            return path  # Path found

        visited.add(vertex)

        for neighbor in graph.get(vertex, []):  # Get neighbors of current node
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return None  # No path found


# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B', 'E'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

start_node = 'A'
end_node = 'F'

path = shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)

if path:
    print("Shortest path:", path)
else:
    print("No path found between", start_node, "and", end_node)


```

This code uses a breadth-first search algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.  It uses a queue to manage the nodes to visit and a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.  The algorithm explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found first.  If no path exists, it returns `None`.

This is a more efficient approach than a brute-force method, especially for larger graphs.  For very large graphs, more sophisticated algorithms like A* search might be necessary for optimal performance.  However, for moderately sized graphs, this BFS approach is efficient and easy to understand.  Remember that this assumes an unweighted graph; for weighted graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm would be more appropriate.

For this $m.$ $S>S_{n-1}$ , SO $S_{n}=S_{n-1}+k(S-S_{n-1})=kS+(1-k)S_{n-1}<S$ a contradiction. Thus $S_n<S$ and $a_{n+1}>0$ for all $n$ , So $S_n$ is increasing and bounded by S . Let S<sub>s</sub> = lim S<sub>n</sub> . If $S_{*}<S$ ,then δ=k(S-S*)>0 , but we can find n such that S* - Sₙ < δ/2 ,which implies that $S_{n+1}=S_{n}+k(S-S_{n})$ >S* + δ/2 , contradicting that $S_n$ is increasing to $S_{*}$ . Thus Sₙ → S

Converges for alll $r>1.$ If $r>1$ then $r^{n}>4$ , say, once n>ln(2)/ln(r) and then the series converges by limi comparison with a geometric series with ratio 1/2229. The numeratoris equalto 1 when 2 is od and 0 when $n$ is even, so the series can be rewritten Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/(2n+1) which diverqes by limit comparison with the harmonic series 231. $(a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}$ or a² + b² ≥ 2ab , so convergence follows from comparison of $2a_nb_n$ with $a^{2}_{n}+b^{2}_{n}$ Since the partial sums on the left are bounded by those on the right, the inequality holds for the infinite series 233.  (ln n)^(-ln n) = e^(-ln(n)ln(ln(n))) If $n$ is sufficiently large, then 
ln(ln n) > 2 >2 >2 so (ln n)⁻ˡⁿⁿ < 1/n² and the series converges by comparison to a $p-$ series. 235. aₙ→0 so aₙ² ≤ |aₙ| for large 71 .
