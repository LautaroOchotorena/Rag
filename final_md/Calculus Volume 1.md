## About Calculus Volume 1

Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives, and integration

### Coverage and scope

Our Calculus Volume 1 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We have worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the project.

### Pedagogical foundation

Throughout Calculus Volume 1 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from determining a safe distance between the grandstand and the track at a Formula One racetrack, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of relative intensity of two earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of theorems.

## Assessments that reinforce key concepts

In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Checkpoint” question. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they've learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they've learned through practice problems

## Early or late transcendentals

Calculus Volume 1 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential and logarithmic functions are introduced informally in Chapter 1 and presented in more rigorous terms in Chapter 6. Differentiation and integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 35 for instructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms

### Comprehensive art program

Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations diagrams, and photographs.

## Chapter Outline.

1.1 Review of Functions 1.2 Basic Classes of Functions 1.3 Trigonometric Functions 1.4 Inverse Functions 1.5 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

## Introduction

In the past few years, major earthquakes have occurred in several countries around the world. In January 2010, an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 hit Haiti.A magnitude 9 earthquake shook northeastern Japan in March 2011. In April 2014, an 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northerm Chile. What do these numbers mean? In particular, how does a magnitude 9 earthquake compare with an earthquake of magnitude 8.2? Or 7.3? Later in this chapter, we show how logarithmic functions are used to compare the relative intensity of two earthquakes based on the magnitude of each earthquake (see Example 1.39).

Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions. In this chapter, we review all the functions necessary to study calculus. We define polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. We review how to evaluate these functions, and we show the properties of their graphs. We provide examples of equations with terms involving these functions and illustrate the algebraic techniques necessary to solve them. In short, this chapter provides the foundation for the material to come. It is essential to be familiar and comfortable with these ideas before proceeding to the formal introduction of calculus in the next chapter

# 1.1 | Review of Functions

# Learning Objectives.

1.1.1Use functional notation to evaluate a function 1.1.2 Determine the domain and range of a function 1.1.3 Draw the graph of a function. 1.1.4 Find the zeros of a function. 1.1.5 Recognize a function from a table of values 1.1.6 Make new functions from two or more given functions. 1.1.7 Describe the symmetry properties of a function.

In this section, we provide a formal definition of a function and examine several ways in which functions are representednamely, through tables, formulas, and graphs. We study formal notation and terms related to functions. We also define composition of functions and symmetry properties. Most of this material will be a review for you, but it serves as a handy reference to remind you of some of the algebraic techniques useful for working with functions

## Functions

Given two sets $A$ and $B$ ,a set with elements that are ordered pairs (x, y), where $x$ is an element of $A$ and $y$ is an element of $B$ ,is a relation from $A$ to $B$ .A relation from $A$ to $B$ defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set. The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the output. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to study them.

## Definition

A function $f$ consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each input to exactly one output. The set of inputs is called the domain of the function. The set of outputs is called the range of the function

For example, consider the function $f$ ,where the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input. Then, the input $x=3$ is assigned to the output $3^{2}=9$ .Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root, every nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

For a general function $f$ with domain $D$ ，we often use $X$ to denote the input and $y$ to denote the output associated with $X$ When doing so, we refer to $X$ as the independent variable and $y$ as the dependent variable, because it depends on $X$ Using function notation, we write $y=f(x)$ , and we read this equation as $“y$ equals $f$ of $A$ ” For the squaring function described earlier, we write $f(x)=x^{2}$

The concept of a function can be visualized using Figure 1.2,Figure 1.3, and Figure 1.4

![](./images/flQFgr7adGzeSecG8GDgMPGxfr03aBvVX.png)

Figure 1.2 A function can be visualized as an input/outpu device.

![](./images/fBS6GwqRN99sOnQ6TR7rqGzLhETzqxDpt.png)

Figure 1.3 A function maps every element in the domain to exactly one element in the range. Although each input can be sent to only one output, two different inputs can be sent to the same output.

![](./images/f0iVPUVm9xxg1Y3g2YVDtGMI7eVN3H3xk.png)
Figure 1.4 In this case, a graph of a function $f$ has a domain

of {1, 2, 3} and a range of {1, 2}. The independent variable is $x$ and the dependent variable is $y$

Visit this applet link (http://www.openstax.org/l/grapherrors) to see more about graphs of functions.
![](./images/fHhRgkEAiufg8YA8phzD0yPSUuHB1YzNn.png)

We can also visualize a function by plotting points $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane where $y=f(x)$ . The graph of a function is the set of all these points. For example, consider the function $f$ ,where the domain is the set D = {1,2,3} and the rule is $f(x)=3-x$ . In Figure 1.5, we plot a graph of this function.

![](./images/fduztYUkVlA82gVVQSPBayAC1UFmaw4iP.png)
Figure 1.5 Here we see a graph of the function $f$ with

domain {1, 2, 3} and rule $f(x)=3-x$ The graph consists of the points $( x$, $f( x) )$ for all $x$ in the domain

Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in $f(x)=x^{2}$ ，with no specific domain given. In this case, the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers λ for which $f(x)$ is a real number. For example, since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the domain of $f(x)=x^{2}$ to be the set of all real numbers. On the other hand, the square root function f(x) = √x only gives a real output if $X$ is nonnegative. Therefore, the domain of the function f(x) = √x is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes called the natural domain

For the functions $f(x)=x^{2}$ and f(x) = √x the domains are sets with an infinite number of elements. Clearly we cannot list all these elements. When describing a set with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or interval notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers, denoted 84 wewrite

$$|x|xhassomeproperty|.$$

We read this as the set of real numbers λ such that X has some property. For example, if we were interested in the set of real numbers that are greater than one but less than five, we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing

{x|1<x<5}

A set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than $a$ and less than $b$ ,can also be denoted using the interval notation a.b.Therefore

(1, 5)=|x| 1<x<5|.

The numbers 1 and 5 are called the endpoints of this set. If we want to consider the set that includes the endpoints, we would denote this set by writing

[1,5]={x|1≤x≤5}.

We can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other. To denote the set of nonnegative real numbers,we would use the set-builder notation

{x|0≤x}.

The smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using interval notation, we would use the symbol ∞ ,which refers to positive infinity, and we would write the set as


[0, ∞) = {x | 0 ≤ x}.

It is important to note that ∞ is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to indicate that this set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to zero. Similarly, if we wanted to describe the set of all nonpositive numbers, we could write

(-∞,0]={x|x≤0}

Here, the notation -∞ refers to negative infinity, and it indicates that we are including all numbers less than or equal to zero, no matter how small. The set

(-∞,∞)={x|x is any real number}

refers to the set of all real numbers.

Some functions are defined using different equations for different parts of their domain. These types of functions are known as piecewise-defined functions. For example, suppose we want to define a function $f$ with a domain that is the set of all real numbers such that $f(x)=3x+1$ for x≥2 and $f(x)=x^{2}$ for $x<2$ . We denote this function by writing

f(x) = {3x+1, x≥2; x², x<2}.

When evaluating this function for an input A the equation to use depends on whether x≥2 or $x<2$ For example, since 5>2 ，we use the fact that $f(x)=3x+1$ for x≥2 and see that $f(5)=3(5)+1=16$ .On the other hand, for $x=-1$ ，we use the fact that $f(x)=x^{2}$ for $x<2$ and see that $f(-1)=1$

## Example 1.1

Evaluating Functions

For the function $f(x)=3x^{2}+2x-1$ ,evaluate

a.f(-2) b.f(v2) C. $f(a+h)$

### Solution

Substitute the given value for $X$ in the formula for $f(x)$

f(-2)=3(-2)²+2(-2)-1=12-4-1=7; f(√2)=3(√2)²+2√2-1=6+2√2-1=5+2√2; f(a+h)=3(a+h)²+2(a+h)-1=3(a²+2ah+h²)+2a+2h-1=3a²+6ah+3h²+2a+2h-1
C

1.1 For $f(x)=x^{2}-3x+5$ . evaluate $f(1)$ and $f(a+h)$

# Example 1.2

## Finding Domain and Range

For each of the following functions, determine the i. domain and i. range.

a. $f(x)=(x-4)^{2}+5$ b. f(x)=√(3x+2)-1 C. f(x)=3/(x-2)

### Solution

a. Consider $f(x)=(x-4)^{2}+5$

i.Since f(x)=(x-4)²+5 is a real number for any real number $X$ the domain of $f$ is the interval (-∞), ∞

i.Since (x-4)²≥0 ,we know f(x) = (x-4)²+5 ≥ 5 .Therefore, the range must be a subse of ∀y|y≥5| .To show that every element in this set is in the range, we need to show that for a given $y$ in that set, there is a real number $X$ such that $f(x)=(x-4)^{2}+5=y$ Solving this equation for $X$ we see that we need $X$ such that

$$(x-4)^2=y-5.$$

This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number $X$ such that

x-4=±√y-5

Since y≥5 ,the square root is well-defined. We conclude that for x=4±√(y-5) ， $f(x)=y$ and therefore the range is {y|y≥5|

b.Consider f(x)=√(3x+2)-1

i.To find the domain of $f$ ，we need the expression 3x+2≥0 .Solving this inequality, we conclude that the domain is {x | x ≥ -2/3}

ii.To find the range of $f$ we note that since √(3x + 2) ≥ 0 f(x)=√(3x+2)-1≥-1 . Therefore, the range of $f$ must be a subset of the set {v|y≥-1} To show that every element in this set is in the range of $f$ ,we need to show that for all $y$ in this set, there exists a real number $X$ in the domain such that $f(x)=y$ Let 
y ≥ -1 .Then, $f(x)=y$ if and only if

√(3x+2) - 1 = y

Solving this equation for $X$ we see that $X$ must solve the equation

√(3x+2)=y+1.

Since 
y ≥ -1 ，such an $x$ could exist. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have $3x+2=(y+1)^{2}$ Therefore, we need

$$3x=(y+1)^{2}-2,$$

which implies

x=(1/3)(y+1)²-2/3

We just need to verify that $X$ is in the domain of $f$ . Since the domain of $f$ consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to -2/3 ，and

(1/3)(y+1)² - 2/3 ≥ -2/3

there does exist an $X$ in the domain of $f$ We conclude that the range of $f$ is |y|y≥-1

c.Consider $f(x)=3/(x-2)$

i.Since $3/(x-2)$ is defined when the denominator is nonzero, the domain is {x|x≠2}

ii.To find the range of $f$ ,we need to find the values of $y$ such that there exists a real number $X$ in the domain with the property that


3/(x - 2) = y

Solving this equation for $X$ we find that

x=3/y+2.

Therefore, as long as y ≠ 0 .there exists areal number $x$ in the domain such that $f(x)=y$ Thus, the range is {v|y ≠ 0}

# Representing Functions

Typically, a function is represented using one or more of the following tools

·A table ·A graph ·A formula

We can identify a function in each form, but we can also use them together. For instance, we can plot on a graph the values from a table or create a table from a formula.

### Tables

Functions described using a table of values arise frequently in real-world applications. Consider the following simple example. We can describe temperature on a given day as a function of time of day. Suppose we record the temperature every hour for a 24-hour period starting at midnight. We let our input variable $x$ be the time after midnight, measured in hours, and the output variable $y$ be the temperature $X$ hours after midnight, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We record our data in Table 1.1.

Hours after Midnight|Temperature Ξ(॰F)|Hours after Midnight|(॰F) Temperature
Table 1.1 Temperature as a Function of Time of Day

We can see from the table that temperature is a function of time, and the temperature decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. However, we cannot get a clear picture of the behavior of the function without graphing it

## Graphs

Given a function $f$ described by a table, we can provide a visual picture of the function in the form of a graph. Graphing the temperatures listed in Table 1.1 can give us a better idea of their fluctuation throughout the day. Figure 1.6 shows the plot of the temperature function.

![](./images/fsBLIFBGi1UvBd0MtbkYhFkSGnS6l5bAG.png)
Figure 1.6 The graph of the data from Table 1.1 shows

temperature as a function of time.

From the points plotted on the graph in Figure 1.6, we can visualize the general shape of the graph. It is often useful to connect the dots in the graph, which represent the data from the table. In this example, although we cannot make any definitive conclusion regarding what the temperature was at any time for which the temperature was not recorded, given the number of data points collected and the pattern in these points, it is reasonable to suspect that the temperatures at other times followed a similar pattern, as we can see in Figure 1.7

![](./images/fBEP0mX61kH2wEKiuOgftasKRCG6A7xA8.png)
Figure 1.7 Connecting the dots in Figure 1.6 shows the

general pattern of the data

# Algebraic Formulas

Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius $r$ is given by the formula A(r) = πr² When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity ν₀ ft/s, its height above the ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula $s(t)=-16t^{2}+v_{0}t.$ When $P$ dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate $r$ compounded continuously, the amount of money after $t$ years is given by the formula $A(t)=Pe^{m}$ .Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form

Given an algebraic formula for a function $f$ ，the graph of $f$ is the set of points $( x$, $f( x)$ where $X$ is in the domain of $f$ and $f(x)$ is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of $f$ consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.

When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of $X$ where $f(x)=0$ are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of $f(x)=x^{2}-4$ are x=±2 .The zeros determine where the graph of $f$ intersects the $X$ -axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the $X$ -axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times.

Another point of interest is the $y$ -intercept, if it exists. The $y$ -intercept is given by (0, $f( 0) ) .$

Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one $y$ -intercept. If $x=0$ is in the domain of a function $f$ ，then $f$ has exactly one $y$ -intercept. If $x=0$ is not in the domain of $f$ ，then $f$ has no $y$ -intercept. Similarly, for any real number $C$ ，if $C$ is in the domain of $f$ ，there is exactly one output $f(c)$ ，and the line $x=c$ intersects the graph of $f$ exactly once. On the other hand, if $C$ is not in the domain of $f$ $f(c)$ is not defined and the line $x=c$ does not intersect the graph of $f$ This property is summarized in the vertical line test.

# Rule: Vertical Line Test

Given a function $f$ ,every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of $f$ no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function

We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8)

![](./images/fWp4elClm9P5G00VQSSV6OHy25io9SFVf.png)
Figure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of

a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points, at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the graph of a function because some vertical lines intersect the set of points more than once.

# Example 1.3

## Finding Zeros and $y$ -Intercepts of a Function

Consider the function $f(x)=-4x+2$

a.Find all zeros of $f$ b.Find the $y$ -intercept (if any). C.Sketch a graph of $f$

### Solution

a.To find the zeros, solve $f(x)=-4x+2=0$ .We discover that $f$ has one zero at $x=1/2$ b.The $y$ -intercept is given by (0, $f(0))=(0,2)$ C.Given that $f$ is a linear function of the form $f(x)=mx+b$ that passes through the points (1/2, 0) and (0, 2), we can sketch the graph of $f$ (Figure 1.9)

![](./images/fGbK2qqEqSDlHtW1GWRzgPSgEdBuxyEtB.png)

Using Zeros and $y$ -Intercepts to Sketch a Graph

Consider the function f(x)=√(x+3)+1

a. Find all zeros of $f$ b.Find the $y$ -intercept (if any). C. Sketch a graph of $f$

### Solution

a.To find the zeros, solve √(x+3)+1=0 .This equation implies √(x+3)=-1 .Since √(x+3) ≥ 0 for all

$X$ ，this equation has no solutions, and therefore $f$ has no zeros b.The $y$ -intercept is given by (0, $f( 0) ) = ( 0$, √3+1 C.To graph this function, we make a table of values. Since we need x+3≥0 ,we need to choose values of x≥-3 .We choose values that make the square-root function easy to evaluate.

Table 1.2

Making use of the table and knowing that, since the function is a square root, the graph of $f$ should be similar to the graph of y = √x we sketch the graph (Figure 1.10)

1.3 Find the zeros of $f(x)=x^{3}-5x^{2}+6x$

# Example 1.5

## Finding the Height of a Free-Falling Object

If a ball is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its height $S$ at time $t$ is given by the function $s(t)=-16t^{2}+100$ where $s$ is measured in feet and $t$ is measured in seconds. The domain is restricted to the interval [0, $c]$ ，where $t=0$ is the time when the ball is dropped and $t=c$ is the time when the ball hits the ground.

a.Create a table showing the height $s(t)$ when $t=0$ ,0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,and 2.5.Using the data from the table, determine the domain for this function. That is, find the time $C$ when the ball hits the ground b.Sketch a graph of $s$

Solution

a.

Height $s$ as a Function of Timet

Since the ball hits the ground when $t=2.5$ ，the domain of this function is the interval [O, 2.5].

b.

![](./images/fHpZn1OfwIZwpawOox1FL3DEOXHTSYw3B.png)

Note that for this function and the function $f(x)=-4x+2$ graphed in Figure 1.9, the values of $f(x)$ are getting smaller as $X$ is getting larger. A function with this property is said to be decreasing. On the other hand, for the function f(x)=√(x+3)+1 graphed in Figure 1.10, the values of $f(x)$ are getting larger as the values of $X$ are getting larger. A function with this property is said to be increasing. It is important to note, however, that a function can be increasing on some interval or intervals and decreasing over a different interval or intervals.For example, using our temperature function in Figure 1.6, we can see that the function is decreasing on the interval (0, 4), increasing on the interval (4, 14), and then decreasing on the interval (14, 23). We make the idea of a function increasing or decreasing over a particular interval more precise in the next definition.

### Definition

We say that a function $f$ is increasing on the interval $I$ if for all X1 $x_1$ x₁, x₂ ∈ I


f(x₁) ≤ f(x₂) when x₁ < x₂

We say $f$ is strictly increasing on the interval $I$ if for all $x_1$ x₂ ∈ I

f(x₁) < f(x₂) when x₁ < x₂

We say that a function $f$ is decreasing on the interval $I$ if for all x₁, x₂ ∈ I

f(x₁) ≥ f(x₂) if x₁ < x₂

We say that a function $f$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $I$ if for all x1 $x_1$ x₁, x₂ ∈ I


f(x₁) > f(x₂) if x₁ < x₂.

For example, the function $f(x)=3x$ is increasing on the interval (-∞, ∞) because $3x_{1}<3x_{2}$ whenever $x_1<x_2$ On the other hand, the function $f(x)=-x^{3}$ is decreasing on the interval (-∞), ∞ because -x²>-x wheneve $x_{1}<x_{2}$ (Figure 1.11).

![](./images/fapoyYbz8psk3xlLVDRvVNYrzgGZkS8pZ.png)
Figure 1.11 (a) The function $f(x)=3x$ is increasing on the interval (-∞), ∞ . (b) The

functiond $f(x)=-x^{3}$ is decreasing on the interval (-∞), ∞

# Combining Functions

Now that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what happens to these properties when we combine functions in different ways,using basic mathematical operations to create new functions.For example, if the cost for a company to manufacture $X$ items is described by the function $C(x)$ and the revenue created by the sale of $X$ items is described by the function $R(x)$ ,then the profit on the manufacture and sale of $X$ items is defined as $P(x)=R(x)-C(x)$ Using the difference between two functions, we created a new function

Alternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example, given the functions $f(x)=x^{2}$ and $g(x)=3x+1$ ，the composite function fog is defined such that

(fog)(x) = f(g(x)) = (g(x))² = (3x+1)².

The composite function g∘f is defined such that

(g∘f)(x)=g(f(x))=3f(x)+1=3x²+1

Note thatthese two newfunctions are different from each other

Combining Functions with Mathematical Operators

To combine functions using mathematical operators, we simply write the functions with the operator and simplify. Given two functions $f$ and $g$ ,we can define four new functions:

(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) Sum
(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x) Difference
(f⋅g)(x) = f(x)g(x) Product
(f/g)(x) = f(x)/g(x) for g(x) ≠ 0 Quotient

## Example 1.6

Combining Functions Using Mathematical Operations

Given the functions $f(x)=2x-3$ and $g(x)=x^{2}-1$ ，find each of the following functions and state its domain.

a. $(f+g)(x)$ b. $(f-g)(x)$ C. (f⋅g)(x) d. (f/g)(x)

### Solution

a。$(f+g)(x)=(2x-3)+(x^{2}-1)=x^{2}+2x-4$ .The domain of this function is the interval (-∞), ∞ b. $(f-g)(x)=(2x-3)-(x^{2}-1)=-x^{2}+2x-2$ .The domain of this function is the interval (-∞), ∞ c. (f·g)(x) = (2x-3)(x²-1) = 2x³ - 3x² - 2x + 3 .The domain of this function is the interval (-∞), ∞ d (f/g)(x)=(2x-3)/(x²-1) The domain of ths funtio is {x|x≠±1}

1.4For $f(x)=x^{2}+3$ and $g(x)=2x-5$ ，find $(f/g)(x)$ and state its domain

?

### Function Composition

When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the temperature $T$ on a given day is described as a function of time $t$ (measured in hours after midnight) as in Table 1.1. Suppose the cost $C$ ，to heat or cool a building for 1 hour, can be described as a function of the temperature $T$ .Combining these two functions, we can describe

the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating $C(T(t)).$ We have defined a new function, denoted C•T which is defined such that (C⋅T)(t)=C(T(t)) for all $t$ in the domain of $T$ This new function is called a composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature is a function of time, it makes sense to define this new function (C∘T)(t) .It does not make sense to consider (T∘C)(t) ,because temperature is not a function of cost.

### Definition

Consider the function $f$ with domain $A$ and range $B$ ，and the function $g$ with domain $D$ and range $E$ .If $B$ is a subset of $D$ then the composite function (g∘f)(x) is the function with domain $A$ such that

|g∘f|(x)=g(f(x)).

A composite function g∘f Can be viewed in two steps.First, the function $f$ maps each input $X$ in the domain of $f$ to its output $f(x)$ in the range of $f$ .Second, since the range of $f$ is a subset of the domain of $g$ ，the output $f(x)$ is an element in the domain of $g$ ，and therefore it is mapped to an output $g(f(x))$ in the range of $g$ . In Figure 1.12, we see a visual image of a composite function.

![](./images/fWuGgMKMkEnHMB7aHwSNOYkpCHutyo5B6.png)
Figure 1.12For the composite function g∘f ，wehave

(g∘f)(1)=4, (g∘f)(2)=5, and (g∘f)(3)=4.

# Example 1.7

Compositions of Functions Defined by Formulas

Consider the functions $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ and $g(x)=1/x$

a.Find (g∘f)(x) and state its domain and range. b. Evaluate (g∘f)(4), (g∘f)(-1/2) C.Find (f∘g)(x)  and state its domain and range. d.Evaluatefg4fg-1/2

### Solution

a.We can find the formula for (g∘f)(x) in two different ways. We could write

(g∘f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x²+1) = 1/(x²+1).

Alternatively, we could write

(g∘f)(x)=g(f(x))=1/(f(x))=1/(x²+1)

Since x² + 1 ≠ 0 for all real numbers $X$ ，the domain of (g∘f)(x) is the set of all real numbers. Since 0 < 1/(x²+1) ≤ 1 ，the range is, at most, the interval (0, 1]. To show that the range is this entire interval, we let $y=1/(x^{2}+1)$ and solve this equation for $x$ to show that for all $y$ in the interval (0. 1], there exists a real number $X$ such that $y=1/(x^{2}+1)$ . Solving this equation for $X$ ，we see that $x^{2}+1=1/y$ which implies that

x=±√(1/y-1)

If $y$ is in the interval (O, 1], the expression under the radical is nonnegative, and therefore there exists a real number $X$ such that $1/(x^{2}+1)=y$ We conclude that the range of g∘f is the interval (0, 1]

(g∘f)(4)=g(f(4))=g(4²+1)=g(17)=1/17; (g∘f)(-1/2)=g(f(-1/2))=g((-1/2)²+1)=g(5/4)=4/5

c. We can find a formula for (f∘g)(x)  in two ways. First, we could write

(f∘g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(1/x) = (1/x)²+1

Alternatively, we could write

(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = (g(x))² + 1 = (1/x)² + 1

The domain of fog is the set of allreal numbers X such that x ≠ 0 .To find the range of $f$ we need to find all values $y$ for which there exists a real number x ≠ 0 such that

(1/x)²+1=y.

Solving this equation for X we see that we need $X$ to satisfy

(1/x)² = y-1

which simplifies to

1/x=±√(y-1).

Finally, we obtain

x = ±1/√(y-1)

Since x²tanx is a real number if and only if $y>1$ ，the range of $f$ is the set $|y|y>1)$

(f∘g)(4) = f(g(4)) = f(1/4) = (1/4)² + 1 = 17/16; (f∘g)(-1/2) = f(g(-1/2)) = f(-2) = (-2)² + 1 = 5

In Example 1.7, we can see that (f∘g)(x) ≠ (g∘f)(x) .This tells us, in general terms, that the order in which we compose functions matters.

1.5 Let $f(x)=2-5x$ Let g(x) = √x Find (f∘g)(x) 

# Example 1.8

Composition of Functions Defined by Tables

Consider the functions $f$ and $g$ described by Table 1.4 and Table 1.5.

### Solution

(g∘f)(3)=g(f(3))=g(-2)=0; (g∘f)(0)=g(4)=5
b.The domain of g∘f is the set {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} .Since the range of $f$ is the set { -2, 0, 2, 4} ， the range of g∘f is the set {0 ,3,5}
(f∘f)(3)=f(f(3))=f(-2)=4
(f∘f)(1)=f(f(1))=f(-2)=4
d.The domain of f∘f is the set {-3, -2, -1}, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} .Since the range of $f$ is the set { -2, 0, 2, 4} ，the range of f∘f is the set {0, 4}

## Example 1.9

Application Involving a Composite Function

A store is advertising a sale of 20% off all merchandise.Caroline has a coupon that entitles her to an additional 15% off any item, including sale merchandise. If Caroline decides to purchase an item with an original price of $x$ dollars, how much will she end up paying if she applies her coupon to the sale price? Solve this problem by using a composite function.

### Solution

Since the sale price is 20% off the original price, if an item is $X$ dollars, its sale price is given by $f(x)=0.80x$ Since the coupon entitles an individual to 15% off the price of any item, if an item is $y$ dollars, the price, after applying the coupon, is given by $g(y)=0.85y$ . Therefore, if the price is originally $X$ dollars, its sale price wil be $f(x)=0.80x$ and then its final price after the coupon will be $g(f(x))=0.85(0.80x)=0.68x$

1.6 If items are on sale for 10% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon for an additional 30% off, what will be the final price for an item that is originally $x$ dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale price?

# Symmetry of Functions

The graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph For example, consider the function $f(x)=x^{4}-2x^{2}-3$ shown in Figure 1.13(a). If we take the part of the curve that lies to the right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the y-axis. In this Case, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the other hand, consider the function $f(x)=x^{3}-4x$ shown in Figure 1.13(b). If we take the graph and rotate it 180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In this case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.

![](./images/fIbaVhF1G3dkknA1FVefTgF1RaUuGIMp0.png)
(b) Symmetry about the origin a Symmetry about the y-axis

Figure 1.13 (a) A graph that is symmetric about the $y$ -axis. (b) A graph that is symmetric about the origin.

If we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of these symmetry properties. But without a graph, how can we determine algebraically whether a function $f$ has symmetry? Looking at Figure 1.14 again, we see that since $f$ is symmetric about the $y$ -axis, if the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, the point $( - x$, $y)$ is on the graph. In other words, $f(-x)=f(x)$ .If a function $f$ has this property, we say $f$ is an even function, which has symmetry about the y-axis. For example, $f(x)=x^{2}$ is even because

$$f(-x)=(-x)^2=x^2=f(x).$$

In contrast, looking at Figure 1.14 again, if a function $f$ is symmetric about the origin, then whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, the point $(-x,-y)$ is also on the graph. In other words, $f(-x)=-f(x)$ .If $f$ has this property, we say $f$ is an odd function, which has symmetry about the origin. For example, $f(x)=x^{3}$ is odd because

$$f(-x)=(-x)^3=-x^3=-f(x).$$

### Definition

If $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all $X$ in the domain of $f$ ，then $f$ is an even function. An even function is symmetric about the y-axis.

If $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ ，then $f$ is an odd function. An odd function is symmetric about the origin.

# Example 1.10

### Even and Odd Functions

Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd,or neither.

$$f(x)=-5x^4+7x^2-2$$

b. f(x) = 2x⁵ - 4x + 5; c. f(x) = 3x/(x²+1)

### Solution

To determine whether a function is even or odd, we evaluate $f(-x)$ and compare it to $f(x)$ and $-f(x)$

a. $f(-x)=-5(-x)^{4}+7(-x)^{2}-2=-5x^{4}+7x^{2}-2=f(x)$ .Therefore, $f$ is even b. $f( - x) = 2( - x) ^{5}- 4( - x) + 5= - 2x^{5}+ 4x+ 5.$ Now, f(-x) ≠ f(x) F f-x)f(x) f(-x) ≠ f(x) urthermore,notingtha $-f(x)=-2x^{5}+4x-5$ ，we see that f(-x) ≠ -f(x) . Therefore, $f$ is neither even nor odd C. $f(-x)=3(-x)/((-x)^{2}+1)=-3x/(x^{2}+1)=-[3x/(x^{2}+1)]=-f(x)$ .Therefore, $f$ is odd

![](./images/f3cGyqqOzTnBDy0SD2uG3Gwb5y3YkR5bG.png)

1.7Determine whether $f(x)=4x^{3}-5x$ is even, odd, or neither

One symmetric function that arises frequently is the absolute value function, written as $|x|$ .The absolute value function is defined as

f(x) = {-x, x<0; x, x≥0}

Some students describe this function by stating that it “makes everything positive." By the definition of the absolute value function, we see that if $x<0$ ，then $|x|=-x>0$ ，and if $x>0$ then $|x|=x>0$ .However, for $x=0$ ， $|x|=0$ Therefore, it is more accurate to say that for all nonzero inputs, the output is positive, but if $x=0$ ，the output $|x|=0$ .We conclude that the range of the absolute value function is {v|y≥0} .In Figure 1.14, we see that the absolute value function is symmetric about the y-axis and is therefore an even function

![](./images/fCDsQNsxggrS2mEIuMPsB9NzEVIL6aY9T.png)
Figure 1.14 The graph of $f(x)=|x|$ is symmetric about the

$y$ -axis.

# Example 1.11

### Working with the Absolute Value Function

Find the domain and range of the function $f(x)=2|x-3|+4$

### Solution

Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, the domain of this function is (-∞, ∞) .Since |x−3|≥0 for all $X$ ，the function f(x)=2|x-3|+4≥4 Therefore, the range is, at most, the set |y| y≥4 To see that the range is, in fact, this whole set, we need to show that for y≥4 there exists a real number $X$ such that

$$2|x-3|+4=y.$$

A real number $X$ satisfies this equation as long as

|x-3|=½(y-4)

Since y≥4 ，we know y - 4 ≥ 0 , and thus the right-hand side of the equation is nonnegative, so it is possible that there is a solution. Furthermore,

|x-3|={( -(x-3) if x<3), (x-3 if x≥3)}

Therefore, we see there are two solutions:

x=±1/2(y-4)+3.

The range of this function is {y|y≥4}

We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some specific classes of functions. We begin by reviewing the basic properties of linear and quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree polynomials. By combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions and distinguish them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter. We finish the section with examples of piecewise defined functions and take a look at how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from its initial form.

# Linear Functions and Slope.

The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function. Linear functions have the form $f(x)=ax+b$ ，where $a$ and $b$ are constants. In Figure 1.15, we see examples of linear functions when $u$ is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if $a>0$ ,the graph of the line rises as $X$ increases. In other words, $f(x)=ax+b$ is increasing on (-∞, ∞) .If $a<0$ the graph of the line falls as $X$ increases. In this case, $f(x)=ax+b$ is decreasing on (-∞, ∞) .If $a=0$ ，the line is horizontal.

![](./images/fLC9thOSgVd2e9o7Cmq4qMIMiYLIlrSHW.png)
Figure 1.15 These linear functions are increasing or

decreasing on (∞,∞) and one function is a horizontal line.

As suggested by Figure 1.15, the graph of any linear function is a line. One of the distinguishing features of a line is its slope. The slope is the change in $y$ for each unit change in $x.$ The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of a line. If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we need to determine the ratio of the change in $y$ versus the change in $x$ . To do so, we choose any two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and

$(x_2,y_2)$ on the line and calculate (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁) In Figure 1.16, we see this ratio is independent o the points chosen

![](./images/fFNCi9wtFPPHIGzP16hGSLxguxiUTLxax.png)
Figure 1.16 For any linear function, the slope

$(y_{2}-y_{1})/(x_{2}-x_{1})$ is independent of thechoice of points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on the line.

### Definition

Consider line $L$ passing through points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ .Let 
Δy=y₂-y₁ and Δx = x₂ - x₁ denote the changes in $y$ and $x$ respectively. The slope of the line is

m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = Δy/Δx

We now examine the relationship between slope and the formula for a linear function. Consider the linear function given by the formula $f(x)=ax+b$ .As discussed earlier, we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We can use our definition of slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by calculating $(y_{2}-y_{1})/(x_{2}-x_{1})$ for any points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on the line. Evaluating the function $f$ at $x=0$ ，we see that $(0,b)$ is a point on this line. Evaluating this function at $x=1$ ，we see that (1, $a+ b)$ is also a point on this line. Therefore, the slope of this line is

(a+b-b)/(1-0) = a.

We have shown that the coefficient $a$ is the slope of the line. We can conclude that the formula $f(x)=ax+b$ describes a line with slope $li$ . Furthermore, because this line intersects the $y$ -axis at the point $(0,b)$ ，we see that the $y$ -intercept for this linear function is $(0,b)$ .We conclude that the formula $f(x)=ax+b$ tells us the slope, $a$ ，and the $y$ -intercept, (0, b), for this line. Since we often use the symbol 777 to denote the slope of a line, we can write

$$f(x)=mx+b$$

to denote the slope-intercept form of a linear function.

Sometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways. For example, suppose the graph of a linear function passes through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ and the slope of the line is 771 .Since any other point $( x$, $f( x) )$ on the graph of $f$ must satisfy the equation

m = (f(x) - y₁)/(x - x₁)

this linear function canbe expressed by writing

$$f(x)-y_1=m(x-x_1).$$

We call thiseauation the point-slope equation for thatlinear function

Since every nonvertical line is the graph of a linear function, the points on a nonvertical line can be described using the slope-intercept or point-slope equations. However, a vertical line does not represent the graph of a function and cannot be expressed in either of these forms. Instead, a vertical line is described by the equation $x=k$ for some constant $k$ .Since neither the slope-intercept form nor the point-slope form allows for vertical lines. we use the notation

$$ax+by=c,$$

where a, $b$ are both not zero, to denote the standard form of a line.

### Definition

Consider a line passing through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ with slope $m$ . The equation

$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$

is the point-slope equation for that line.

Consider a line with slope $m$ and $y$ -intercept $(0,b)$ .The equatior

$$y=mx+b$$

is an equation for that line in slope-intercept form

The standard form of a line isgiven by the equation

$$ax+by=c,$$

where a and $b$ are both not zero.This form ismore general because it allows for a vertical line, $x=k$

# Example 1.12

Finding the Slope and Equations of Lines

Consider the line passing through the points (11, 4) and (4, 5),as shown in Figure 1.17

a.Find the slope of the line.

b.Find an equation for this linear function in point-slope form C.Find an equation for this linear function in slope-intercept form.

### Solution

a.The slope of the line is

m=(y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁)=(5-(-4))/(-4-11)=-9/15=-3/5

b. To find an equation for the linear function in point-slope form, use the slope $m=-3/5$ and choose any point on the line. If we choose the point (11, 4), we get the equation

f(x)+4=-3/5(x-11)

C. To find an equation for the linear function in slope-intercept form, solve the equation in part b. for $f(x)$ When we do this, we get the equation

f(x) = -(3/5)x + 13/5

# Example 1.13

### A Linear Distance Function

Jessica leaves her house at 5:50 a.m. and goes for a 9-mile run. She returns to her house at 7:08 a.m. Answer the following questions, assuming Jessica runs at a constant pace.

a.Describe the distance $D$ (in miles) Jessica runs as a linear function of her run time (in minutes) b.Sketch a graph of $D$ C.Interpret the meaning of the slope

## Solution

a.At time $t=0$ Jessica is at her house, so $D(0)=0$ .At time $t=78$ minutes, Jessica has finished running 9 mi ,S0 $D(78)=9$ The slope of the linear function is

m = (9 - 0)/(78 - 0) = 3/26

The $y$ -intercept is (0,0) ,so the equation for this linear function is

D(t)=3t/26.

b.To graph $D$ ,，use the fact that the graph passes through the origin and has slope $m=3/26$

![](./images/ffTIHkCpuIK5oPMkYB2CCvih7zlPzFenm.png)

C.The slope m=3/26≈0.115 describes the distance (in miles) Jessica runs per minute, or her average velocity.

# Polynomials

A linear function is a special type of a more general class of functions: polynomials. A polynomial function is any function that can be written in the form

$$f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0$$

for some integer n ≥ 0 and constants $a_{n}$ aₙ₋₁, …, a₀ ，where aₙ≠0 1. In the case when $n=0$ we allow for $a_{0}=0$ if $a_{0}=0$ ，the function $f(x)=0$ is called the zero function. The value $n$ is called the degree of the polynomial; the constant $u_{n}$ is called the leading coefficient. A linear function of the form $f(x)=mx+b$ is a polynomial of degree 1 if m ≠ 0 and degree 0 if $m=0$ .A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant function.A polynomial function of degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular, a quadratic function has the form $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$ where a≠0 .A polynomial function of degree3is called a cubic function.

### Power Functions

Some polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form $f(x)=ax^{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the exponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then $f(x)=ax^{n}$ is a polynomial. If 77 is even, then f(x)=ax'' is an even function because $f(-x)=a(-x)^{n}=ax^{n}$ if 77 is even. If 72 is odd, then $f(x)=ax^{n}$ is an odd function because $f(-x)=a(-x)^{n}=-ax^{n}$ if 77 is odd (Figure 1.18)

![](./images/f2ZG0n089MrWtcug8Kf8ffiMel6G1uQmA.png)
Figure 1.18 (a) For any even integer $H$ ， $f(x)=ax^{n}$ is an even function. (b) For any odd

integer 72 $f(x)=ax^n$ is an odd function

## Behavior at Infinity

To determine the behavior of a function $f$ as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values $f(x)$ as the inputs, $x$ become larger. For some functions, the values of $f(x)$ approach a finite number. For example, for the function $f(x)=2+1/x$ the values $1/x$ become closer and closer to zero for all values of $X$ as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say “ $f(x)$ approaches two as $X$ goes to infinity,” and we write f(x)→2 as x→∞ .The line $y=2$ is a horizontal asymptote for the function $f(x)=2+1/x$ because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as $x$ gets larger.

For other functions, the values $f(x)$ may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of $X$ as they get larger. In that case, we say ‘“ $f(x)$ approaches infinity as $X$ approaches infinity,” and we write f(x)→∞ as x → 0 .For example, for the function $f(x)=3x^{2}$ ，the outputs $f(x)$ become larger as the inputs $X$ get larger. We can conclude that the function $f(x)=3x^{2}$ approaches infinity as $X$ approaches infinity, and we write 3x²→∞ as x→∞ The behavior as x→-∞ and the meaning of f(x)→-∞ as x→∞ or x→-∞ can be defined similarly. We can describe what happens to the values of $f(x)$ as X→∞ and as x→-∞ as the end behavior of the function

To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$ .If $a>0$ ，the values f(x)→∞ as x → ±∞ .If $a<0$ ，the values f(x)→-∞ as x → ±∞ .Since the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if $a>0$ ; the parabola opens downward if $a<0$ .(See Figure 1.19(a).)

Now consider a cubic function $f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d$ If $a>0$ ，then f(x)→∞ as X→∞ and f(x)→-∞ as x→-∞ .If $a<0$ ，then f(x)→-∞ as x→∞ and f(x)→∞ as x→-∞ .As we can see from both of these graphs, the leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See Figure 1.19(b).)

![](./images/fg3ugN3x025HNQ6gLvLgF9pbnzD8YiNbx.png)
Figure 1.19 (a) For a quadratic function, if the leading coefficient $a>0$ the parabola opens

upward. If $a<0$ , the parabola opens downward. (b) For a cubic function $f$ ，if the leading coefficient $a>0$ ，the values f(x)→∞ as x→∞ and the values f(x)→-∞ as x→-∞ .If the leading coefficient $a<0$ the opposite is true.

### Zeros of Polynomial Functions

Another characteristic of the graph of a polynomial function is where it intersects the $X$ -axis. To determine where a function $f$ intersects the $X$ -axis, we need to solve the equation $f(x)=0$ for $X$ In the case of the linear function $f(x)=mx+b$ the $x$ -intercept is given by solving the equation $mx+b=0$ .In this case, we see that the $x$ -intercept is given by $(-b/m,0)$ .In the case of a quadratic function, finding the $X$ -intercept(s) requires finding the zeros of a quadratic equation: $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ .In some cases, it is easy to factor the polynomial $ax^{2}+bx+c$ to find the zeros. If not, we make use of the quadratic formula.

### Rule: The Quadratic Formula

Consider the quadratic equation

$$ax^{2}+bx+c=0,$$

where a≠0 .The solutions of this equation are given by the quadratic formula


x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.

If the discriminant $b^{2}-4ac>0$ ,this formula tells us there are two real numbers that satisfy the quadratic equation If $b^{2}-4ac=0$ ,this formula tells us there is only one solution, and it is a real number. If $b^{2}-4ac<0$ , no real numbers satisfy the quadratic equation.

In the case of higher-degree polynomials, it may be more complicated to determine where the graph intersects the $X$ -axis. In some instances, it is possible to find the $x$ -intercepts by factoring the polynomial to find its zeros. In other cases, it is impossible to calculate the exact values of the $x$ -intercepts. However, as we see later in the text, in cases such as this, we can use analytical tools to approximate (to a very high degree) where the $x$ -intercepts are located. Here we focus on the graphs of polynomials for which we can calculate their zeros explicitly.

# Example 1.14

### Graphing Polynomial Functions

For the following functions a. and b., i. describe the behavior of $f(x)$ as x → ±∞ ,i. find all zeros of $f$ ，and ii. sketch a graph of $f$

a. f(x)=-2x²+4x-1
b. f(x)=x³-3x²-4x

### Solution

a.The function $f(x)=-2x^{2}+4x-1$ is a quadratic function

i.Because $a=-2<0$ ,as x → ±∞ ， f(x)→-∞ i.To find the zeros of $f$ use the quadratic formula. The zeros are

x = (-4 ± √(4² - 4(-2)(-1)))/(2(-2)) = (-4 ± √8)/(-4) = (-4 ± 2√2)/(-4) = (2 ± √2)/2

i. To sketch the graph of $f$ ,.use the information from your previous answers and combine it with the fact that the graph is a parabola opening downward

![](./images/fQYoHnEaASvsCrUaWZfB1SVLIg20K1CPc.png)

b.The function $f(x)=x^{3}-3x^{2}-4x$ is a cubic function

i.Because $a=1>0$ , as x→∞ f(x)→∞ .As x→-∞ ， f(x)→-∞ ii.To find the zeros of $f$ we need to factor the polynomial. First, when we factor $X$ out of all the terms, we find

$$f(x)=x(x^2-3x-4).$$

Then, when we factor the quadratic function $x^{2}-3x-4$ we find

$$f(x)=x(x-4)(x+1).$$

![](./images/fbbg56NhR7KOGrGQqWXM6SumLklN9ssgR.png)

Therefore, the zeros of $f$ are $x=0$ 4, -1

ii. Combining the results from parts i. and i., draw a rough sketch of $f$

1.10 Consider the quadratic function $f(x)=3x^{2}-6x+2$ .Find the zeros of $f$ Does the parabola open upward or downward?

### Mathematical Models

A large variety of real-world situations can be described using mathematical models. A mathematical model is a method of simulating real-life situations with mathematical equations. Physicists, engineers, economists, and other researchers develop models by combining observation with quantitative data to develop equations, functions, graphs, and other mathematical tools to describe the behavior of various systems accurately. Models are useful because they help predict future outcomes. Examples of mathematical models include the study of population dynamics, investigations of weather patterns, and predictions of product sales.

As an example, let's consider a mathematical model that a company could use to describe its revenue for the sale of a particular item. The amount of revenue $R$ a company receives for the sale of $n$ items sold at a price of $p$ dollars per item is described by the equation R=p⋅n . The company is interested in how the sales change as the price of the item changes. Suppose the data in Table 1.6 show the number of units a company sells as a function of the price per item.


3|52|15|83

Table 1.6 Number of Units Sold $n$ (in Thousands)as a Function of Price per Unit $p$ (in Dollars)

In Figure 1.20, we see the graph the number of units sold (in thousands) as a function of price (in dollars). We note from the shape of the graph that the number of units sold is likely a linear function of price per item, and the data can be closely approximated by the linear function $n=-1.04p+26$ for 
0 ≤ p ≤ 25 where $n$ predicts the number of units sold in thousands. Using this linear function, the revenue (in thousands of dollars) can be estimated by the quadratic function

R(p) = p(-1.04p + 26) = -1.04p² + 26p

for 
0 ≤ p ≤ 25 . In Example 1.15, we use this quadratic function to predict the amount of revenue the company receives depending on the price the company charges per item. Note that we cannot conclude definitively the actual number of units sold for values of $P$ ,for which no data are collected. However, given the other data values and the graph shown, it seems reasonable that the number of units sold (in thousands) if the price charged is $P$ dollars may be close to the values predictec by the linear function $n=-1.04p+26$

![](./images/fYmBh5XnQf9bkfM9nblhHAy7yPCFSN1ok.png)
Figure 1.20The data collected for the number of items sold as a function of

price is roughly linear. We use the linear function $n=-1.04p+26$ to estimate this function.

## Maximizing Revenue

A company is interested in predicting the amount of revenue it will receive depending on the price it charges for a particular item. Using the data from Table 1.6, the company arrives at the following quadratic function to mode revenue $R$ (in thousands of dollars) as a function of price per item $P$

R(p) = p(-1.04p + 26) = -1.04p² + 26p

for 
0 ≤ p ≤ 25

a.Predict the revenue if the company sells the item at a price of $p=85$ and p=17$ b.Find the zeros of this function and interpret the meaning of the zeros C.Sketch a graph of $R$ d.Use the graph to determine the value of $P$ that maximizes revenue. Find the maximum revenue

### Solution

a.Evaluating the revenue function at $p=5$ and $p=17$ ,we can conclude that

R(5)=-1.04(5)²+26(5)=104, so revenue = S104,000; R(17)=-1.04(17)²+26(17)=141.44, so revenue = S141,440.

b. The zeros of this function can be found by solving the equation $-1.04p^{2}+26p=0$ .When we factor the quadratic expression, we get $p(-1.04p+26)=0$ 1.The solutions to this equation are given by $p=0$ , 25. For these values of $p$ the revenue is zero. When p=0$ ,the revenue is zero because the company is giving away its merchandise for free. When p=25$ ,the revenue is zero because the price is too high, and no one will buy any items. C. Knowing the fact that the function is quadratic, we also know the graph is a parabola. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downward. One property of parabolas is that they are symmetric about the axis, so since the zeros are at $p=0$ and $p=25$ the parabola must be symmetric about the line halfway between them, or $p=12.5$

![](./images/fg8PVecnVaX1XG42g2UR1CzKlNF3vCeQc.png)
d. The function is a parabola with zeros at $p=0$ and $p=25$ ， and it is symmetric about the line

$p=12.5$ , so the maximum revenue occurs at a price of p=12.50$ per item. At that price, the revenue is R(p) = -1.04(12.5)² + 26(12.5)162$ 500

## Algebraic Functions

By allowing for quotients and fractional powers in polynomial functions, we create a larger class of functions. An algebraic function is one that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of algebraic functions are rational functions and root functions.

Just as rational numbers are quotients of integers, rational functions are quotients of polynomials. In particular, a rational function is any function of the form $f(x)=p(x)/q(x)$ ，where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials. For example

f(x) = (3x-1)/(5x+2) and g(x) = 4/(x²+1)

are rational functions. A root function is a power function of the form $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ ，where TE is a positive integer greater than one. For example, f(x) = x^(1/2) = √x is the square-root function and g(x) = x^(1/3) = ³√x is the cube-root function. By allowing for compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions. For example, f(x) = √(4 - x²) is an algebraic function

# Example 1.16

### Finding Domain and Range for Algebraic Functions

For each of the following functions, find the domain and range.

f(x) = (3x-1)/(5x+2)

b. To find the domain of $f$ ,we need 4-x²≥0 .Or, 4≥x² Or x²≤4 , the solution to which is -2 ≤ x ≤ 2 .Therefore, the domain is {x|-2 ≤ x ≤ 2} If -2 ≤ x ≤ 2 ，then 0≤4-x²≤4 Therefore, 0≤√(4-x²)≤2 and the range of $f$ is {y | 0 ≤ x ≤ 2}

### Solution

a.It is not possible to divide by zero, so the domain is the set of real numbers $x$ such that x≠-2/5 .Td find the range, we need to find the values $y$ for which there exists a real number $x$ such that

y = (3x-1)/(5x+2)

When we multiply both sides of this equation by $5x+2$ ，we see that $X$ must satisfy the equation
$$5xy+2y=3x-1.$$

From this equation, we can see that X must satisfy

$$2y+1=x(3-5y).$$

If $y=3/5$ ,this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as y≠3/5

x = (2y + 1)/(3 - 5y)

satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of $f$ is ⟨y|v≠3/5⟩

b.To find the domain of $f$ ，weneed 4-x²≥0 .When we factor, we write 4 - x² = (2-x)(2+x) ≥ 0 .This inequality holds if and only if both terms are positive or both terms are negative. For both terms to be positive, we need to find $X$ such that

2-x≥0 and 2+x≥0.

These two inequalities reduce to 2 ≥ x and x≥-2 .Therefore, the set {x|-2 ≤ x ≤ 2} mustbe part of the domain. For both terms to be negative, we need

2-x≤0 and 2+x≥0.

These two inequalities also reduce to 2 ≤ x and x≥-2 .There are no values of $X$ that satisfy both of these inequalities. Thus, we can conclude the domain of this function is {x|-2 ≤ x ≤ 2}

If -2 ≤ x ≤ 2 ，then 0≤4-x²≤4 .Therefore, 0≤√(4-x²)≤2 ，and the range of $f$ is {y|0≤y≤2}

1.11 Find the domain and range for the function $f(x)=(5x+2)/(2x-1)$

The root functions $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ have defining characteristics depending on whethere 77 is odd or even. For all even integers n≥2 ,， the domain of $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ is the interval [0,∞ 0. For all od integers n ≥ 1 ， the domain of $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ is the set of all real numbers. Since $x^{1/n}=(-x)^{1/n}$ for odd integers 71 $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ is an odd function if $n$ is odd. See the graphs of root functions for different values of $n$ in Figure 1.21.

![](./images/fA6bBG8CCX4eBbcYUKvVmW4NRr49p0xFR.png)
Figure 1.21 (a) If $n$ is even, the domain of f(x)=ⁿ√x is [0,∞ 0. (b)If $n$ is odd, the domain of f(x)=ⁿ√x is

(-∞), ∞ and the function f(x)=ⁿ√x is an odd function.

## Example 1.17

 Finding Domains for Algebraic Functions

For each of the following functions,determine the domain of the function

a. f(x) = 3/(x²-1) b. f(x) = (2x+5)/(3x²+4) c. f(x) = √(4-3x) d. f(x) = ³√(2x-1)

### Solution

a.You cannot divide by zero, so the domain is the set of values $X$ such that x²-1≠0 . Therefore, the domain is {x|x≠±1}

b.You need to determine the values of $X$ for which the denominator is zero. Since 3x²+4≥4 for all real numbers $X$ the denominator is never zero. Therefore, the domain is (-∞, ∞)

C.Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the domain is the set of values $X$ for

which 4-3x≥0 Therefore, the domain is {x | x ≤ 4/3}

d.The cube root is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is the interval (-∞, ∞)

1.12Find the domain for each of the following functions: $f(x)=(5-2x)/(x^{2}+2)$ and g(x) = √(5x-1)

## Transcendental Functions

Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be described by basic algebraic operations. These functions are known as transcendental functions because they are said to “transcend,” or go beyond algebra. The most common transcendental functions are trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. A trigonometric function relates the ratios of two sides of a right triangle. They are sinx, cosx,tanx, cotx, secx, and cscx. (We discuss trigonometric functions later in the chapter.) An exponential function is a function of the form $f(x)=b^{x}$ where the base $b>0$ b >0 b>0, b≠1 b≠1 b≠1 .A logarithmic function is a function of the form f(x) = logₓ(x) for some constant $b>0$ b≠1 ，where logₓ(b)=y if and only if bʸ=x (We also discuss exponential and logarithmic functions later in the chapter.)

## Example 1.18

Classifying Algebraic and Transcendental Functions

Classify each of the following functions,a. through c., as algebraic or transcendental

a.f(x=4+) b. f(x)=2x2 c. f(x) = sin(2x)

### Solution

a.Since this function involves basic algebraic operations only,it is an algebraic function

b.This function cannot be written as a formula that involves only basic algebraic operations, so it is transcendental. (Note that algebraic functions can only have powers that are rational numbers.

C.As in part b., this function cannot be written using a formula involving basic algebraic operations only therefore, this function is transcendental

![](./images/fRGcTCoqFbzS7OzPU11uuXl9wdilqMtbz.png)

1.13 Is $f(x)=x/2$ an algebraic or a transcendental function?

### Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. A function with this property is known as a piecewise-defined function. The absolute value function is an example of a piecewise-defined function because

the formula changes with the sign of $X.$

f(x) = {-x, x<0; x, x≥0}

Other piecewise-defined functions may be represented bv completely different formulas.depending on the part of the domain in which a point falls. To graph a piecewise-defined function, we graph each part of the function in its respective domain, on the same coordinate system. If the formula for a function is different for $X<a$ and $x>a$ ，we need to pay special attention to what happens at $A=U$ when we graph the function.Sometimes the graph needs to include an open or closed circle to indicate the value of the function at $A=U$ .We examine this in the next example.

### Example 1.19

## Graphing a Piecewise-Defined Function

Sketch a graph of the following piecewise-defined function:

f(x)={x+3, x<1; (x-2)², x≥1}

## Solution

Graph the linear function $y=x+3$ on the interval (-∞), 1) and graph the quadratic function $y=(x-2)^{2}$ on the interval [1, 00 ).Since the value of the function at $x=1$ is given by the formula $f(x)=(x-2)^{2}$ we see that $f(1)=1$ . To indicate this on the graph, we draw a closed circle at the point (1, 1). The value of the function is given by $f(x)=x+2$ for all $x<1$ ，but not at $x=1$ .To indicate this on the graph, we draw ar open circle at (1, 4).

# Example 1.20

### Parking Fees Described by a Piecewise-Defined Function

In a big city, drivers are charged variable rates for parking in a parking garage. They are charged 10$ for the first hour or any part of the first hour and an additional 2$ for each hour or part thereof up to a maximum of S30 for the day. The parking garage is open from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight.

a.Write a piecewise-defined function that describes the cost $C$ to park in the parking garage as a functior of hours parked $x$ b.Sketch a graph of this function $C(x)$

### Solution

a.Since the parking garage is open 18 hours each day, the domain for this function is {x|0 < x ≤ 18} .The cost to park a car at this parking garage can be described piecewise by the function

C(x) = {10, 0<x≤1; 12, 1<x≤2; 14, 2<x≤3; 16, 3<x≤4; ...; 30, 10<x≤18}

b.The graph of the function consists of several horizontal line segments.

1.15The cost of mailing a letter is a function of the weight of the letter. Suppose the cost of mailing a letter is 49φ for the first ounce and 21φ for each additional ounce. Write a piecewise-defined function describing the cost $C$ as a function of the weight $x$ for 0<x≤3 ，where $C$ is measured in cents and $x$ is measured in ounces.

## Transformations of Functions

We have seen several cases in which we have added, subtracted, or multiplied constants to form variations of simple

functions. In the previous example, for instance, we subtracted 2 from the argument of the function $y=x^{2}$ to get the functiond $f(x)=(x-2)^{2}$ .This subtraction represents a shift of the function $y=x^{2}$ two units to the right. A shift, horizontally or vertically, is a type of transformation of a function. Other transformations include horizontal and vertical scalings, and reflections about the axes.

A vertical shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each output $y$ For $c>0$ ，the graph of $f(x)+c$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x)$ up $L$ units, whereas the graph of $f(x)-c$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x)$ down $C$ units. For example, the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{3}+4$ is $y=x^3$ shifted up 4 units; the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{3}-4$ is the graph of $y=x^{3}$ shifted down 4 units (Figure 1.23)

![](./images/fIGhwhB4qoXyKZNqgt7LUt7ApuAUd3ND9.png)
(a) (b)

Figure 1.23 (a) For $c>0$ ，the graph of $y=f(x)+c$ is a vertical shift up $c$ units of the graph of $y=f(x)$ . (b) For $c>0$ ，the graph of $y=f(x)-c$ is a vertical shift down $C$ units of the graph of $y=f(x)$

A horizontal shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each input $X$ .For $c>0$ ，the graph of $f(x+c)$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x)$ to the left $C$ units; the graph of $f(x-c)$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x)$ to the right C units. Why does the graph shift left when adding a constant and shift right when subtracting a constant? To answer this question,let's look at an example.

Consider the function $f(x)=|x+3|$ and evaluate this function at $x-3$ .Since $f(x-3)=|x|$ and $x-3<x$ ，the graph of $f(x)=|x+3|$ is the graph of $y=|x|$ shifted left 3 units. Similarly, the graph of $f(x)=|x-3|$ is the graph of $y=|x|$ shifted right 3 units (Figure 1.24)

![](./images/fdG289DNMuTnHY9MrfP0GEOuvgNnclwxX.png)
Figure 1.24 (a)For $c>0$ ，the graph of $y=f(x+c)$ is a horizontal shift left $c$ units of the graph of $y=f(x)$ -(b) For

$c>0$ ，the graph of $y=f(x-c)$ is a horizontal shift right $c$ units of the graph of $y=f(x)$

A vertical scaling of a graph occurs if we multiply all outputs $y$ of a function by the same positive constant. For $c>0$ the graph of the function $cf(x)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ scaled vertically by a factor of C .If $c>1$ ，the values of the outputs for the function $cf(x)$ are larger than the values of the outputs for the function $f(x)$ ; therefore, the graph has been stretched vertically. If $0<c<1$ ，then the outputs of the function $cf(x)$ are smaller, so the graph has been compressed. For example, the graph of the function $f(x)=3x^{2}$ is the graph of $y=x^{2}$ stretched vertically by a factor of 3, whereas the graphof $f(x)=x^{2}/3$ is the graph of $y=x^{2}$ compressed vertically by a factor of 3 (Figure 1.25)

![](./images/fcglN4gxfxexVWMODPqGIxbSAqccH1B0q.png)
Figure 1.25 (a) If $c>1$ ， the graph of $y=cf(x)$ is a vertical stretch of the graph

of $y=f(x)$ (b) If $0<c<1$ ， the graph of $y=cf(x)$ is a vertical compression of the graph of $y=f(x)$

The horizontal scaling of a function occurs if we multiply the inputs $X$ by the same positive constant. For $c>0$ ，the graph of the function $f(cx)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ scaled horizontally by a factor of C .If $c>1$ ，the graph of $f(cx)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ compressed horizontally. If $0<c<1$ ，the graph of $f(cx)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ stretched horizontally. For

example, consider the function f(x)=√(2x) and evaluate $f$ at $x/2$ .Since f(x/2) = √x the graph of f(x)=√(2x) is the graph of y = √x compressed horizontally. The graph of y = √(x/2) is a horizontal stretch of the graph of y = √x (Figure 1.26).

![](./images/fPddidwRsX5kzqY01eQZFQ58AndKThUiu.png)
Figure 1.26 (a)If $c>1$ ，the graph of $y=f(cx)$ is a horizontal compression of the graph

of $y=f(x)$ . (b) If $0<c<1$ ， the graph of $y=f(cx)$ is a horizontal stretch of the graph of $y=f(x)$

We have explored what happens to the graph of a function $f$ when we multiply $f$ by a constant $c>0$ to get a new function $cf(x)$ .We have also discussed what happens to the graph of a function $f$ when we multiply the independent variable $A$ by $c>0$ to get a new function $f(cx)$ .However, we have not addressed what happens to the graph of the function if the constant $C$ is negative. If we have a constant $c<0$ we can write L as a positive number multiplied by -1 : but, what kind of transformation do we get when we multiply the function or its argument by -17 When we multiply all the outputs by -1 ，we get a reflection about the $X$ -axis. When we multiply all inputs by -1 ，we get a reflection about the y-axis.For example.the graph of f(x)=-（x²+1)is the graph of y=(x²+1)reflected about the $X$ -axis The graph of $f(x)=(-x)^{3}+1$ is the graph of $y=x^{3}+1$ reflected about the $y$ -axis (Figure 1.27)

![](./images/fABoLhKSusUZrtE7gi0ddwzzZsdnFOXUM.png)
Figure 1.27 (a) The graph of $y=-f(x)$ is the graph of

$y=f(x)$ reflected about the $X$ -axis. (b) The graph of $y=f(-x)$ is the graph of $y=f(x)$ reflected about the $y$ -axis.

If the graph of a function consists of more than one transformation of another graph, it is important to transform the graph in the correct order. Given a function $f(x)$ ,the graph of the related function $y=cf(a(x+b))+d$ can be obtained from the graph of $y=f(x)$ by performing the transformations in the following order.

1.Horizontal shift of the graph of $y=f(x)$ .If $b>0$ ，shift left. If $b<0$ shift right 2.Horizontal scaling of the graph of $y=f(x+b)$ by a factor of $|a|$ .If $a<0$ ，reflect the graph about the $y$ -axis 3.Vertical scaling of the graph of $y=f(a(x+b))$ by a factor of $|c|$ .If $c<0$ ，reflect the graph about the $X$ -axis 4. Vertical shift of the graph of $y=cf(a(x+b))$ . If $d>0$ ，shift up. If $d<0$ ,shift down.

We can summarize the different transformations and their related effects on the graph of a function in the following table.

1.3.1 Convert angle measures between degrees and radians

1.3.2 Recognize the triangular and circular definitions of the basic trigonometric functions. 1.3.3 Write the basic trigonometric identities. 1.3.4 Identify the graphs and periods of the trigonometric functions. 1.3.5Describe the shift of a sine or cosine graph from the equation of the function

Trigonometric functions are used to model many phenomena, including sound waves, vibrations of strings, alternating electrical current, and the motion of pendulums. In fact, almost any repetitive, or cyclical, motion can be modeled by some combination of trigonometric functions.In this section,we define the six basic trigonometric functions and look at some of the main identities involving these functions.

## Radian Measure

To use trigonometric functions, we first must understand how to measure the angles. Although we can use both radians and degrees, radians are a more natural measurement because they are related directly to the unit circle, a circle with radius 1. The radian measure of an angle is defined as follows. Given an angle θ ，let $s$ be the length of the corresponding arc on the unit circle (Figure 1.30). We say the angle corresponding to the arc of length 1 has radian measure 1.

![](./images/f97ZepwpGFQgiRWqKnW7Vr3lQEIqaKk3u.png)
Figure 1.30 The radian measure of an angle θ is the arc

length $s$ of the associated arc on the unit circle.

Since an angle of 360° corresponds to the circumference of a circle, or an arc of length 2π ,we conclude that an angle with a degree measure of 360° has a radian measure of 2π Similarly, we see that 180° is equivalent to π radians. Table 1.8 shows the relationship between common degree and radian values.

Degrees|Radians|Degrees|Radians
0|0|120|2π/3
30|π/6|135|3π/4
45|π/4|150|5π/6
60|π/3|180|π

### Solution

1=π rad/180°=180°/π rad

a. 
225° = 225°⋅(π/180°) = (5π)/4 rad

## The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions allow us to use angle measures, in radians or degrees, to find the coordinates of a point on any circlenot only on a unit circle—or to find an angle given a point on a circle. They also define the relationship among the sides and angles of a triangle

To define the trigonometric functions, first consider the unit circle centered at the origin and a point $P=(x,y)$ on the unit circle. Let θ be an angle with an initial side that lies along the positive $X$ -axis and with a terminal side that is the line segment $OP$ .An angle in this position is said to be in standard position (Figure 1.31). We can then define the values of the six trigonometric functions for θ in terms of the coordinates $X$ and $y$

![](./images/fxYxOd8mc9oKToGDCxQH1DY3d347Ma7TR.png)

Figure 1.31 The angle θ is in standard position. The values of the trigonometric functions for θ are defined in terms of the coordinates $x$ and $y$

### Definition

Let $P=(x,y)$ be a point on the unit circle centered at the origin 0 .Let θ be an angle with an initial side along the positive $x$ -axis and a terminal side given by the line segment $OP$ The trigonometric functions are then defined as

sinθ=y, cscθ=1/y, cosθ=x, secθ=1/x, tanθ=y/x, cotθ=x/y

If $x=0$ ,sec θ and tan θ are undefined. If $y=0$ then cotθandcsc θ are undefined

We can see that for a point $P=(x,y)$ on a circle of radius $r$ with a corresponding angle θ the coordinates $x$ andy satisfy

cosθ=x/r, x=rcosθ, sinθ=y/r, y=rsinθ

The values of the other trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of $x,y$ ，and $r$ (Figure 1.32)

![](./images/fWy5NZpTWcM8g3QaBM9igxftE9rkyX7Bp.png)

Figure 1.32 Fora point $P= ( x$, $y)$ on a circle of radius $r$ the coordinates $x$ and $y$ satisfy x=rcosθ and y = r sin θ

Table 1.9 shows the values of sine and cosine at the major angles in the first quadrant. From this table, we can determine the values of sine and cosine at the corresponding angles in the other quadrants. The values of the other trigonometric functions are calculated easily from the values of sinθ and cosθ

## Example 1.23

### Evaluating Trigonometric Functions

Evaluate each of the following expressions.

a sin(2π/3) b. cos(-5π/6)

c. tan(g)

### Solution

a. On the unit irle, the angle θ=2π/3 corresponds to the point (-1/2,√3/2). Therefore, sin(2π/3) = y = √3/2

![](./images/fppUo142tYacUb24EA6NgUBgZYXtaurD0.png)

b. An angle θ=-5π/6 corresponds to a revolution in the negative direction, as shown. Therefore.
cos(-5π/6) = x = -√3/2.

![](./images/fwEngyO7yY1r2GMwZWybaPkBAXdeug4Oy.png)

C. An angle θ = (15π)/4 = 2π + (7π)/4 Therefor, this angle corresponds to more than one revolution, as shown. Knowing the fact that an angle of 7π/4 corresponds to the point (√2/2, -√2/2), we can conclude tha
tan(15π/4)=y/x=-1

1.18 Evaluate cos(3π/4) and sin(-π/6)

As mentioned earlier, the ratios of the side lengths of a right triangle can be expressed in terms of the trigonometric functions evaluated at either of the acute angles of the triangle. Let θ be one of the acute angles. Let $A$ be the length of the adjacent leg, 0 be the length of the opposite leg, and $H$ be the length of the hypotenuse. By inscribing the triangle into a circle of radius $H$ ，as shown in Figure 1.33,we see that $A$ $H$ ，and 0 satisfy the following relationships with $b$

![](./images/fg3TZECDguqkHWQk63kZ4iqXFzWpF1pgp.png)

## Constructing a Wooden Ramp.

A wooden ramp is to be built with one end on the ground and the other end at the top of a short staircase. If the top of the staircase is 4 ft from the ground and the angle between the ground and the ramp is to be 10° ，how

long does the ramp need to be?

### Solution

Let $x$ denote the length of the ramp. In the following image, we see that $x$ needs to satisfy the equation sin(10°) = 4/x Solving this equation for $X.$ we see that x=4/sin(10°)≈23.035 ft.

## Trigonometric Identities

A trigonometric identity is an equation involving trigonometric functions that is true for all angles θ for which the functions are defined. We can use the identities to help us solve or simplify equations. The main trigonometric identities are listed next.

## Rule: Trigonometric Identities

## Reciprocal identities

tanθ=sinθ/cosθ, cotθ=cosθ/sinθ, cscθ=1/sinθ, secθ=1/cosθ

### Pythagorean identities

sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ

### Addition and subtraction formulas

sin(α±β) = sinαcosβ ± cosαsinβ, cos(α±β) = cosαcosβ ∓ sinαsinβ

### Double-angle formulas

sin(2θ)=2sinθcosθ
cos(2θ)=2cos²θ-1=1-2sin²θ=cos²θ-sin²θ

## Example 1.25

# Solving Trigonometric Equations

For each of the following equations, use a trigonometric identity to find all solutions.

a. 1+cos(2θ)=cosθ b. sin(2θ)=tanθ

### Solution

a.Using the double-angle formula for cos(2θ) we see that θ is a solution of

1+cos(2θ)=cosθ

if andonly if

1+2cos²θ-1=cosθ

which is true if and only if

2cos²θ-cosθ=0

To solve this equation, it is important to note that we need to factor the left-hand side and not divide both sides of the equation by cosθ .The problem with dividing by cosθ θ 0 is that it is possible that cosθ is zero. In fact, if we did divide both sides of the equation by cosθ we would miss some of the solutions of the original equation.Factoring the left-hand side of the equation, we see that θ is a solution of this equation if and only if

cosθ(2cosθ-1)=0

Since cos θ = 0 when

θ=π/2, π/2±π, π/2±2π,…

and 
cosθ=1/2 when

θ=π/3, π/3±2π,… or θ=-π/3, -π/3±2π,…

we conclude that the set of solutions to this equation is

θ = π/2 + nπ, θ = π/3 + 2nπ, and θ = -π/3 + 2nπ, n = 0, ±1, ±2,...

b.Using the double-angle formula for sin(2θ) and the reciprocal identity for tan(θ) (#) (θ) ，the equation can be written as

2sinθcosθ=sinθ/cosθ

To solve this equation, we multiply both sides by cosθ 0 θ to eliminate the denominator, and say that if θ satisfies this equation, then θ satisfies the equatior

2sinθcos²θ-sinθ=0

However, we need to be a little careful here. Even if θ satisfies this new equation, it may not satisfy the original equation because, to satisfy the original equation, we would need to be able to divide both sides of the equation by cosθ .However, if cos θ = 0 we cannot divide both sides of the equation by cosθ

Therefore, it is possible that we may arrive at extraneous solutions. So, at the end, it is important to check for extraneous solutions. Returning to the equation, it is important that we factor sinθ out of both terms on the left-hand side instead of dividing both sides of the equation by sinθ .Factoring the left-hand side of the equation, we can rewrite this equation as

sin θ(2cos²θ - 1) = 0

Therefore, the solutions are given by the angles θ such that sin θ = 0 or cos²θ=1/2 The solutions of the first equation are 
θ=0 θ = 0 θ=0, ±π, ±2π, … The solutions of the second equation are θ=π/4 ， (π/4) ± (π/2) ， (π/4)±π,… After checking for extraneous solutions, the set of solutions to the equation is

θ = nπ and θ = π/4 + nπ/2, n = 0, ±1, ±2, …

1.20 Find all solutions to the equation cos(2θ) = sinθ

## Example 1.26

Proving a Trigonometric Identity

Prove the trigonometric identity 1+tan²θ=sec²θ

### Solution

We start with the identity

sin²θ + cos²θ = 1

Dividing both sides of this equation by cos²θ we obtain

sin²θ/cos²θ+1=1/cos²θ

Since sin 0/cos θ=tanθ and 1/cosθ=secθ we conclude that

tan²θ+1=sec²θ.

# Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions

We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions repeat. We can see this pattern in the graphs of the functions. Let $P= ( x$, $y)$ be a point on the unit circle and let θ be the corresponding angle .Since the angle θ and 
9) θ + 2π correspond to the same point $P$ the values of the trigonometric functions at θ and at 
9) θ + 2π are the same. Consequently, the trigonometric functions are periodic functions. The period of a function $f$ is defined to be the smallest positive value $p$ such that $f(x+p)=f(x)$ for all values $X$ in the domain of $f$ .The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of 2π .Since the tangent and cotangent functions repeat on an interval of length π ，their period is λ (Figure 1.34)

![](./images/fnfzz5SCr8T9W5gUGdycTLcyCivngZ9UX.png)
Figure 1.34 The six trigonometric functions are periodic.

Just as with algebraic functions, we can apply transformations to trigonometric functions.In particular, consider the following function

f(x) = A sin(B(x-α)) + C

In Figure 1.35,the constant $a$ causes a horizontal or phase shift. The factor $B$ changes the period. This transformed sine function will have a period 2π/|B| .The factor $A$ results in a vertical stretch by a factor of $|A|$ .We say $|A|$ is the “amplitude of $f$ "The constant $C$ causes a vertical shift.

Figure 1.35A graph of a general sine function.

Notice in Figure 1.34 that the graph of y=cos x is the graph of y = sin x shifted to the left π/2 units. Therefore, we

can write cos x=sin(x+π/2) .Similarly, we can view the graph of y = sin x as the graph of y=cos x shifted right π/2 units, and state that sinx=cos(x-π/2)

A shifted sine curve arises naturally when graphing the number of hours of daylight in a given location as a function of the day of the year. For example, suppose a city reports that June 21 is the longest day of the year with 15.7 hours and December 21 is the shortest day of the year with 8.3 hours. It can be shown that the function

h(t)=3.7sin((2π/365)(t-80.5))+12

is a model for the number of hours of daylight $h$ as a function of day of the year $t$ Figure 1.36)

## Example 1.27

 Sketching the Graph of a Transformed Sine Curve

Sketch a graph of f(x) = 3sin(2(x - π/4)) + 1

### Solution

This graph is a phase shift of y = sin(x) to the right by π/4 units, followed by a horizontal compression by a factor of 2, a vertical stretch by a factor of 3, and then a vertical shift by 1 unit. The period of $f$ is π

# 1.4 | Inverse Functions.

# Learning Objectives

1.4.1 Determine the conditions for when a function has an inverse. 1.4.2 Use the horizontal line test to recognize when a function is one-to-one. 1.4.3 Find the inverse of a given function. 1.4.4 Draw the graph of an inverse function. 1.4.5 Evaluate inverse trigonometric functions.

An inverse function reverses the operation done by a particular function. In other words, whatever a function does, the inverse function undoes it. In this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary conditions for an inverse function to exist. We examine how to find an inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss properties of the inverse trigonometric functions,

## Existence of an Inverse Function

We begin with an example. Given a function $f$ and an output $y=f(x)$ ,we are often interested in finding what value or values $x$ were mapped to $y$ by $f$ .For example, consider the function $f(x)=x^{3}+4$ .Since any output $y=x^{3}+4$ ,we can solve this equation for $X$ to find that the input is x=∛(y-4) This equation defines $X$ as a function of $y.$ Denoting this function as $f^{-1}$ ，and writing x=f⁻¹(y)=∛(y-4) we see that for any $X$ in the domain of $f$, f⁻¹(f(x)) = f⁻¹(x³+4) = x Thus, this new function, $f^{-1}$ ，“undid" what the original function $f$ did. A function with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.

## Definition

Given a function $f$ with domain $D$ and range $R$ ,its inverse function (if it exists) is the function $f^{-1}$ with domain $R$ and range $D$ such that $f^{-1}(y)=x$ if $f(x)=y$ In other words, for a function $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$

f⁻¹(f(x)) = x for all x in D, and f(f⁻¹(y)) = y for all y in R.

Note that $f^{-1}$ is read as “f inverse.” Here, the -1 is not used as an exponent and f⁻¹(x)≠1/f(x) .Figure 1.37 shows the relationship between the domain and range of $f$ and the domain and range of $f^{-1}$

Figure 1.37 Given a function $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ 1 $^{- 1}$, $f^{- 1}( y) = x$ if and only if $f(x)=y$ The range of $f$ becomes the domain of $f^{-1}$ and the domain of $f$ becomes the range of $f^{-1}$

Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to define an inverse function, we need to map each

input to exactly one output. For example, let's try to find the inverse function for $f(x)=x^{2}$ . Solving the equation $y=x^{2}$ for $X$ ,we arrive at the equation x = ±√y This equation does not describe $X$ as a function of $y$ because there are two solutions to this equation for every $y>0$ . The problem with trying to find an inverse function for $f(x)=x^2$ is that two inputs are sent to the same output for each output $y>0$ . The function $f(x)=x^{3}+4$ discussed earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output is called a one-to-one function

### Definition

We say a $f$ is a one-to-one function if f(x₁)≠f(x₂) when x₁≠x₂

One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two inputs can be sent to the same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the xy -plane, according to the horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line test determines whether a function is one-to-one (Figure 1.38)

### Rule: Horizontal Line Test

A function $f$ is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of $f$ no more than once.

![](./images/fkb6UrdAAgB3uLKzABpQo64hnA8T4pVbd.png)
Figure 1.38 (a) The function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not one-to-one

because it fails the horizontal line test. (b) The function $f(x)=x^{3}$ is one-to-one because it passes the horizontal line test.

# Example 1.28

Determining Whether a Function Is One-to-One

For each of the following functions, use the horizontal line test to determine whether it is one-to-one

![](./images/fOvSGPPw2cysqk6QIgDKIyXkwleZqm8gG.png)

b.

### Solution

a.Since the horizontal line $y=n$ for any integer n ≥ 0 intersects the graph more than once, this function is not one-to-one.

![](./images/fIMizkF5I712yqfKM5IoFUkXn9LYy0dqc.png)
b.Since every horizontal line intersects the graph once (at most), this function is one-to-one.

# Finding a Function's Inverse

We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of $f$ to elements in the range of $f$ . The inverse function maps each element from the range of $f$ back to its corresponding element from the domain of $f$ .Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function $f$ ，given any $y$ in the range of $f$ ,we need to determine which $X$ in the domain of $f$ satisfies $f(x)=y$ Since $f$ is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value $X$ We can find that value $X$ by solving the equation $f(x)=y$ for $X$ Doing so, we are able to write $X$ as a function of y' where the domain of this function is the range of $f$ and the range of this new function is the domain of $f$ .Consequently, this function is the inverse of $f$ ，and we write $x=f^{-1}(y)$ .Since we typically use the variable $X$ to denote the independent variable and $y$ to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of $x$ and $y$ and write $y=f^{-1}(x)$ .Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ on the same axes.

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding an Inverse Function

1. Solve the equation $y=f(x)$ for $X$ 2. Interchange the variables $x$ and $y$ and write $y=f^{-1}(x)$

# Example 1.29

### Finding an Inverse Function

Find the inverse for the function $f(x)=3x-4$ .State the domain and range of the inverse function. Verify that
$$f^{-1}(f(x))=x.$$

### Solution

Follow the steps outlined in the strategy

Step 1. If $y=3x-4$ ，then $3x=y+4$ and x=1/3y+4/3. Step 2. Rewrite as y=x/3+4/3 and let $y=f^{-1}(x)$ Therefore, f⁻¹(x) = x/3 + 4/3

Since the domain of $f$ is (-∞), ∞ ，the range of $f^{-1}$ is (-∞), ∞ .Since the range of $f$ is (-∞), ∞ ，the domain of $f^{-1}$ is (-∞), ∞

You can verify that $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ by writing

f⁻¹(f(x)) = f⁻¹(3x-4) = (1/3)(3x-4) + 4/3 = x

Note that for $f^{-1}(x)$ to be the inverse of $f(x)$ ，both $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ and $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $X$ in the domair of the inside function.

1.24 Find the inverse of the function $f(x)=3x/(x-2)$ . State the domain and range of the inverse function

### Graphing Inverse Functions.

Let's consider the relationship between the graph of a function $f$ and the graph of its inverse. Consider the graph of $f$ shown in Figure 1.39 and a point $(a,b)$ on the graph. Since $b=f(a)$ ，then f⁻¹(b)=a .Therefore, when we graph $f^{-1}$ ，the point $( b$, $a)$ is on the graph. As a result, the graph of $f^{-1}$ is a reflection of the graph of $f$ about the line $y=x$

![](./images/foEQRuyzAo1YAMuWFqPnrYbGrw7h5rhzd.png)
Figure 1.39 (a) The graph of this function $f$ shows point (a, b) on the graph of $f.$ (b)

Since (a, b) is on the graph of $f$ ，the point $( b$, $a)$ is on the graph of $f^{-1}$ .The graph of $f^{-1}$ is a reflection of the graph of $f$ about the line $y=x$

### Example 1.30

Sketching Graphs of Inverse Functions

For the graph of $f$ in the following image, sketch a graph of $f^{-1}$ by sketching the line $y=x$ and using symmetry. Identify the domain and range of $f^{-1}$

![](./images/fDPNgQ9Mggs8wGSES0m3WRUVLkmiGGn75.png)

### Solution

Reflect the graph about the line $y=x$ . The domain of $f^{-1}$ is [0,∞ 000 ). The range of $f^{-1}$ is [-2,∞) .By using the preceding strategy for finding inverse functions, we can verify that the inverse function is $f^{-1}(x)=x^{2}-2$ as shown in the graph.

1.25 Sketch the graph of $f(x)=2x+3$ and the graph of its inverse using the symmetry property of inverse functions.

### Restricting Domains

As we have seen, $f(x)=x^{2}$ does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a subset of the domain of $f$ such that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a restricted domain. By restricting the domain of $f$ ,we can define a new function $g$ such that the domain of $g$ is the restricted domain of $f$ and $g(x)=f(x)$ for all X in the domain of $g$ . Then we can define an inverse function for $g$ on that domain.For example, since $f(x)=x^{2}$ is one-to-one on the interval [0, 00 ), we can define a new function B such that the domain of $g$ is [0, ∞ 000 and $g(x)=x^{2}$ for all $X$ in its domain. Since $g$ is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse function, given by the formula g⁻¹(x)=√x On the other hand, the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is also one-to-one on the domain ( -∞ , O]. Therefore, we could also define a new function $h$ such that the domain of $h$ is (-∞,0] and $h(x)=x^{2}$ for all $X$ in the domain of $h$ . Then $h$ is a one-to-one function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula h⁻¹(x) = -√x  (Figure 1.40)

![](./images/f9sCoZZMGmKK9pcWEl5Mwd4bsPPr7FCAd.png)
Figure 1.40 (a) For $g(x)=x^2$ restricted to [0, ∞ . g⁻¹(x) = √x (b) For

$h(x)=x^{2}$ restricted to (-∞), 0], h⁻¹(x)=-√x.

## Example 1.31

Restricting the Domain

Consider the function $f(x)=(x+1)^{2}$

a.Sketch the graph of $f$ and use the horizontal line test to show that $f$ is not one-to-one.

b.Show that $f$ is one-to-one on the restricted domain [-1, ∞) 000 . Determine the domain and range for the inverse of $f$ on this restricted domain and find a formula for $f^{-1}$

### Solution

a.The graph of $f$ is the graph of $y=x^{2}$ shifted left 1 unit. Since there exists a horizontal line intersecting the graph more than once, $f$ is not one-to-one.

![](./images/f60fANSFr3uA7WO1dmPY21RCfkMzaG7b7.png)

b.On the interval [-1, ∞) ， $f$ is one-to-one.

![](./images/fApWtDevZvNGMuMtWeUwGT4EnsPexSuPg.png)

The domain and range of $f^{-1}$ are given by the range and domain of $f$ respectively. Therefore, the domain of $f^{-1}$ is [0, ∞ and the range of $f^{-1}$ is [-1, ∞ .To find a formula for $f^{-1}$ ，solve the equation $y=(x+1)^{2}$ for $X.$ If $y=(x+1)^{2}$ ，then x = -1 ± √y Since we are restricting the domain to the interval where x≥-1 ， we need ±√y≥0 . Therefore, x = -1 + √y . Interchanging $X$ and $y$ we write y=-1+√x and conclude that f⁻¹(x)=-1+√x

1.26 Consider $f(x)=1/x^{2}$ restricted to the domain (-∞,0) .Verify that $f$ is one-to-one on this domain Determine the domain and range of the inverse of $f$ and find a formula for $f^{-1}$

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic, and therefore they are not one-to-one. However, if we restrict the domain of a trigonometric function to an interval where it is one-to-one, we can define its inverse. Consider the sine function (Figure 1.34). The sine function is one-to-one on an infinite number of intervals, but the standard convention is to restrict thedomaint the interval 
[-π/2,π/2]. By ding so, we efine the inverse sine function on the domain -1, I such hat for any $x$ in the interval [-1, 1], the ivers sine function tellsus which angle θ in the interval [-π/2,π/2] satisfies sinθ = x Similarly,we can restrict the domains of the other trigonometric functions to define inverse trigonometric functions, which are functions that tell us which angle in a certain interval has a specified trigonometric value.

### Definition

The inverse sine function, denoted sin⁻¹ or arcsin, and the inverse cosine function, denoted 
cos⁻¹ or arccos, are defined on the domain D = {x | -1 ≤ x ≤ 1} as follows:

sin⁻¹(x) = y if and only if sin(y) = x and -π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2; cos⁻¹(x) = y if and only if cos(y) = x and 0 ≤ y ≤ π.

The inverse tangent function, denoted tan⁻¹ or arctan, and inverse cotangent function, denoted $cot^{-1}$ or arccot, are defined on the domain D = {x | -∞ < x < ∞} as follows

tan⁻¹(x) = y if and only if tan(y) = x and -π/2 < y < π/2; cot⁻¹(x) = y if and only if cot(y) = x and 0 < y < π.

The inverse cosecant function, denoted $csc^{-1}$ or arccsc, and inverse secant function, denoted $sec^{-1}$ or arcsec, are defined on the domain D={x||x|≥1} as follows

csc⁻¹(x)=y iff csc(y)=x and -π/2≤y≤π/2, y≠0; sec⁻¹(x)=y iff sec(y)=x and 0≤y≤π, y≠π/2

To graph the inverse trigonometric functions, we use the graphs of the trigonometric functions restricted to the domains defined earlier and reflect the graphs about the line $y=x$ (Figure 1.41)

![](./images/fqNVdafRFIn8uDONvTVKx5XQKZ6Bi0hdD.png)
Figure 1.41 The graph of each of the inverse trigonometric functions is a reflection about the line $y=x$ of

the corresponding restricted trigonometric function.

Go to the following site (http://www.openstax.org/l/2o_inversefun) for more comparisons of functions and their inverses.

When evaluating a inverse tigonomtric funtion, the outpu is an angle Forexampe, to evaluate cos⁻¹(1/2), we need to find an angle θ such that cosθ=1/2 Clearly, many angles have this property. However, given the definition of 
cos⁻¹ ，we need the angle θ that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval [0, π] .We conclude that cos⁻¹(1/2)=π/3 We now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse. For example, consider the two expressions sinsin-12 and sin⁻¹(sin(π)) . For the first one, we simplify as follows

sin(sin⁻¹(√2/2))=sin(π/4)=√2/2

For the second one, we have

sin⁻¹(sin(π))=sin⁻¹(0)=0.

The inverse function is supposed to “undo” the original function, so why isn’t sin⁻¹(sin(π))=π ? Recalling our definition of inverse functions, a function $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ satisfy the conditions $f(f^{-1}(y))=y$ for all $y$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ for all $X$ in the domain of $f$, So what happened here? The issue is that the inverse sine function, sin⁻¹ ，is the inverse of the restricted sine function defined on the domain , Therefore, for $X$ in the interval ， it is true that sin⁻¹(sinx)=x However, for values of $X$ outside this interval, the equation does not hold, even though sin⁻¹(sin x) is defined for all real numbers $X$

What about sin(sin⁻¹y) ? Does that have a similar issue? The answer is no. Since the domain of sin⁻¹ is the interval [-1,1] .we conclude that sin(sin⁻¹y) = y if  -1 ≤ y ≤ 1  and the expression is not defined for other values of $y$ Td Summarize,

sin(sin⁻¹y)=y if -1≤y≤1

and

sin⁻¹(sin x) = x if -π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2.

Similarly, for the cosine function,.

cos(cos⁻¹y)=y if -1≤y≤1

and

cos⁻¹(cos x)=x if 0≤x≤π.

Similar properties hold for the other trigonometric functions and their inverses.

## Example 1.32

Evaluating Expressions Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Evaluate each of the following expressions.

a. sin⁻¹(-√3/2) b. tan(tan⁻¹(-1/√3))

c. cos⁻¹(cos(5π/4))  d. sin⁻¹(cos(2π/3))

### Solution

a.Evaluating sin⁻¹(-√3/2) is equivalent to finding theangle θ such that sinθ=-√3/2 and -/20/2.The angle θ=-π/3 satisfiesthesetwoconditions.Therefore

b.First we use the fact that tan⁻¹(-1/√3) = -π/6 ．Then tan(π/6)=-1/√3 Therefore
tan(tan⁻¹(-1/√3))=-1/√3.

c.To evaluate cos⁻¹(cos(5π/4)), first use the fact that cos(5π/4)=-√2/2 .Then we need to find the angle θ such that cos(θ) = -√2/2 and 0≤θ≤π Since 3π/4 satisfies both these conditions, we have
cos(cos⁻¹(5π/4))=cos(cos⁻¹(-√2/2))=3π/4.

d.Since cos(2π/3)=-1/2 ，we need to evaluate sin⁻¹(-1/2) .That is, we need to find the angle θ such that sin(θ)=-1/2 and -π/2≤θ≤π/2 .Since -π/6 satisfies both these conditions, we can conclude that sin⁻¹(cos(2π/3)) = sin⁻¹(-1/2) = -π/6.

### The Maximum Value of a Function

In many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to know the maximum value a function can obtain, even if we don't know its exact value at a given instant.For instance, if we have a function describing the strength of a roof beam, we would want to know the maximum weight the beam can support without breaking. If we have a function that describes the speed of a train, we would want to know its maximum speed before it jumps off the rails. Safe design often depends on knowing maximum values.

This project describes a simple example of a function with a maximum value that depends on two equation coefficients We will see that maximum values can depend on several factors other than the independent variable x

1. Consider the graph in Figure 1.42 of the function y=sin x+cos x Describe its overall shape. Is it periodic? How do you know?

Using a graphing calculator or other graphing device, estimate the $x$ -and $y$ -values of the maximum point for the graph (the first such point where $x>0$ ).It may be helpful to express the $x$ -value as a multiple of nt

 2. Now consider other graphs of the form y = A sin x + B cos x for various values of A and B. Sketch the graph when $A=2$ and $B=1$ , and find the $x$ - and y-values for the maximum point.(Remember to express the $x$ -value as a multiple of in, if possible.) Has it moved?

3.Repeat for $A=1$ $B=2$ Is there any relationship to what you found in part (2)

4.Complete the following table, adding a few choices of your own for A and B


$A$|$B$|$x$|$y$|$A$|$B$|$x$|$y$
0|1| | |√3|1| | 
1|0| | |1|√3| | 
1|1| | |12|5| | 
1|2| | |5|12| | 
2|1| | | | | | 
2|2| | | | | | 
3|4| | | | | | 
4|3| | | | | | 


5.Try to figure out the formula for the y-values

6.The formula for the $x$ -values is a litle harder. The most helpful points from the table are (1, 1). (1, V3), (V3, 1). (Hint: Consider inverse trigonometric functions.) 7. If you found formulas for parts (5) and (6), show that they work together. That is, substitute the $x$ -value formula you found into y = A sin x + B cos x and simplify it to arrive at the $y$ -value formula you found

Exponential functions arise in many applications. One common example is population growth.

For example, if a population starts with $P_{0}$ individuals and then grows at an annual rate of 2% ，its population after 1 year is

$$P(1)=P_0+0.02P_0=P_0(1+0.02)=P_0(1.02).$$

Its population after 2 years is

P(2)=P(1)+0.02P(1)=P(1)(1.02)=P₀(1.02)²

In general, its population after $t$ years is

$$P(t)=P_0(1.02)^t,$$

which is an exponential function. More generally, any function of the form $f(x)=b^{x}$ ，where b >0 $b>0$ $b> 0$, b≠1, b≠1 b≠1 is an exponential function with base $b$ and exponent $X$ . Exponential functions have constant bases and variable exponents. Note that a function of the form $f(x)=x^{b}$ for some constant $b$ is not an exponential function but a power function

To see the difference between an exponential function and a power function, we compare the functions $y=x^{2}$ and $y=2^x$ In Table 1.10,we see that both $2^{x}$ and $x^{2}$ approach infinity as x→∞ .Eventually, however, $2^{x}$ becomes larger than $x^2$ and grows more rapidly as X→∞ . In the opposite direction, as x→-∞ x² → ∞ whereas 2ˣ → 0 . The line $y=0$ is a horizontal asymptote for $y=2^{x}$

In Figure 1.43, we graph both $y=x^{2}$ and $y=2^x$ to show how the graphs differ

but $2^{x}$ grows more rapidly than $x^2$ .As x→-∞ x² → ∞ whereas 2ˣ → 0

### Evaluating Exponential Functions

Recall the properties of exponents: If $x$ is a positive integer, then we define bˣ=b⋅b⋯b (with $X$ factors of $E$ ）.If X is a negative integer, then $x=-y$ for some positive integer $y$ and we define $b^{x}=b^{-y}=1/b^{y}$ Also, $b^{0}$ is defined to be 1. If X is a rational number, then $x=p/q$ ，where $P$ and $q$ are integers and ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=∫ₐᶜf(x)dx+∫ᶜᵇf(x)dx For example, 9³/²=√(9³)=27 .However, how is $b^{x}$ defined if $x$ is an irrtional number? For example, what do we mean by 2^√2? This is too complex a question for us to answer fully right now; however, we can make an approximation. In Table 1.11 we list some rational numbers approaching √2 and the values of $2^{x}$ for each rational number $X$ are presented as well. We claim that if we choose rational numbers $x$ getting closer and closer to √2 the values of $2^{x}$ get closer and closer to some number $L$ .We define that number $L$ tobe 2^√2


$x$|1.4|1.41|1.414|1.4142|1.41421|1.414213
$2^{x}$|2.639|2.65737|2.66475|2.665119|2.665138|2.665143

## Example 1.33

## Bacterial Growth

Suppose a particular population of bacteria is known to double in size every 4 hours. If a culture starts with 1000 bacteria, the number of bacteria after 4 hours is n(4)=1000·2 . The number of bacteria after 8 hours is n(8) = n(4)•2 = 1000•2² In general, the number of bacteria after $4m$ hours is n(4m) = 1000⋅2ᵐ Letting

$t=4m$ .we see that the number of bacteria after $t$ hours is n(t) = 1000·2ᵗ/⁴ .Find the number of bacteria after 6 hours.10 hours.and 24 hours

### Solution

The number of bacteria after 6 hours is given by n(6)=1000⋅2⁶/⁴≈2828 bacteria. The number of bacteria after 10 hours is given by n(10) = 1000·2¹⁰/⁴ ≈ 5657 bacteria. The number of bacteria after 24 hours is given by n(24)=1000⋅2⁶=64,000 bacteria.

### Graphing Exponential Functions

For any base $b>0$ ， b≠1 t he exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ is defined for all real numbers $X$ and $b^{x}>0$ .Therefore, the domain of $f(x)=b^{x}$ is (-∞), ∞ and the range is (0, ∞ 0. To graph $b^{x}$ we note that for $b>1$ ， $b^{x}$ is increasing on (-∞), ∞ and bˣ→∞ as x→∞ ,whereas bˣ→0 as x→-∞ . On the other hand, if $0<b<1$ ， $f(x)=b^{x}$ is decreasing on (-∞), ∞ and bˣ → 0 as x→∞ whereas bˣ→∞ as x→-∞ （Figure 1.44)

Note that exponential functions satisfy the general laws of exponents. To remind you of these laws, we state them as rules.

## Rule: Lawsof Exponents

For any constants $a>0$ $b>0$ .and for all x and y.

1. bˣ⋅bʸ=bˣ⁺ʸ
bˣ/bʸ = bˣ⁻ʸ

3. $(b^{x})^{y}=b^{xy}$ 4. $(ab)^{x}=a^{x}b^{x}$ 5. aˣ/bˣ=(a/b)ˣ

### Example 1.34

Using the Laws of Exponents

a. (2x²/³)^3/(4x⁻¹/³)² b. (x³y⁻¹)²/(xy²)⁻²

### Solution

(2x²/³)^3/(4x⁻¹/³)²=8x²/16x⁻²/³=x⁸/³/2

b.We can simplify as follows

### The Number e

A special type of exponential function appears frequently in real-world applications. To describe it, consider the following example of exponential growth,which arises from compounding interest in a savings account. Suppose a person invests $P$ dollars in a savings account with an annual interest rate $Y$ compounded annually. The amount of money after 1year is

$$A(1)=P+rP=P(1+r).$$

The amount of money after 2 years is

$$A(2)=A(1)+rA(1)=P(1+r)+rP(1+r)=P(1+r)^{2}.$$

More generally, the amount after $t$ years is

$$A(t)=P(1+r)^{t}.$$

If the money is compounded 2 times per year, the amount of money after half a year is

A(1/2) = P + (r/2)P = P(1 + r/2)

The amount of money after 1 year is

A(1)=A(1/2)+(r/2)A(1/2)=P(1+r/2)+(r/2)(P(1+r/2))=P(1+r/2)²

After $t$ years, the amount of money in the account is

A(t) = P(1+r/2)²ᵗ

More generally, if the money is compounded 72 times per year, the amount of money in the account after $t$ years is given by the function

A(t)=P(1+r/n)^(nt)

What happens as n→∞ ? To answer this question, we let $m=n/r$ and write

(1+r/n)^(nt)=(1+1/m)^(mrt)

and examine the behavior of $(1+1/m)^{m}$ as m→∞ ,using a table of values (Table 1.12).


$m$|10|100|1000|10,000|100,000|1,000,000
$m$ 1 1 +|2.5937|2.7048|2.71692|2.71815|2.718268|2.718280


Table 1.12 Values of (1+1/m)ᵐ as m→∞

Looking at this table, it appears that (1+1/m)ᵐ is approaching a number between 2.7 and 2.8 as m→∞ .In fact, $(1+1/m)^{m}$ does approach some number as m → ∞ .We call this number $e$ . To six decimal places of accuracy,

e≈2.718282

The letter $e$ was first used to represent this number by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler during the 1720s. Although Euler did not discover the number, he showed many important connections between $e$ and logarithmic functions. We still use the notation $e$ today to honor Euler's work because it appears in many areas of mathematics and because we can use it in many practical applications

Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts $P$ dollars in an account at an annual interest rate $r$ compounded continuously, then $A(t)=Pe^{rn}$ This function may be familiar. Since functions involving base $e$ arise often in applications,we call the function $f(x)=e^{x}$ the natural exponential function. Not only is this function interesting because of the definition of the number $e$ ,but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important property

Since $e>1$ ，we know $e^{X}$ is increasing on (-∞, ∞) .In Figure 1.45, we show a graph of $f(x)=e^{X}$ along with a tangent line to the graph of at $x=0$ .We give a precise definition of tangent line in the next chapter; but, informally, we say a tangent line to a graph of $f$ at $x=a$ is a line that passes through the point (a, $f(a)]$ and has the same “slope” as $f$ at that point . The function $f(x)=e^{x}$ is the only exponential function $b^{x}$ with tangent line at $x=0$ that has a slope of 1. As we see later in the text, having this property makes the natural exponential function the most simple exponential function to use in many instances

![](./images/fOgXyw7g42N3cFBYatSVD7YX0Xfi6Ldxr.png)

Figure 1.45 The graph of $f(x)=e^{x}$ has a tangent line with slope 1 at $x=0$

# Example 1.35

# Compounding Interest

Suppose 500$ is invested in an account at an annual interest rate of r=5.5% compounded continuously

a.Let $t$ denote the number of years after the initial investment and $A(t)$ denote the amount of money in the account at time $t.$ Find a formula for $A(t)$ b.Find the amount of money in the account after 10 years and after 20 years

### Solution

a.If $P$ dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate $r$ compounded continuously, ther $A(t)=Pe^{rt}$ .Here P=500$ and $r=0.055$ . Therefore, $A(t)=500e^{0.055r}$

b.After 10 years, the amount of money in the account is

$A(10)=500e⁰⋅⁵⁵≈866.63.$$

After 20 years, the amount of money in the account is

$$A(20)=500e^{0.055\cdot20}=500e^{1.1}\approx\1,502.08$

# Logarithmic Functions

Using our understanding of exponential functions, we can discuss their inverses, which are the logarithmic functions. These come in handy when we need to consider any phenomenon that varies over a wide range of values, such as pH in chemistry or decibels in sound levels.

The exponential function $f(x)=b^{x}$ is one-to-one, with domain (-∞), ∞ and range (0, ∞ 000 .Therefore, it has an inverse function, called the logarithmic function with base $b$ .For any b>0 $b>0$ b>0, b≠1 b≠1 b≠1 ，the logarithmic function with base $b$ denoted logb ,has domain (0, ∞ and range (-∞), ∞ ，and satisfies

logₓ(y) = b if and only if b'=x

For example,

![](./images/fXxOq9Tfn40kmhBtUykmpLT4gXaQILNlp.png)

Furthermore, sincee y = logₓ(b) and $y=b^{x}$ are inverse functions

log_b(b^x)=x and b^(log_b(x))=x.

The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function loge .Since this function uses natural $e$ as its base, it is called the natural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x) or ln x to mean 
loge(x) .For example

ln(e)=logₑ(e)=1, ln(e³)=logₑ(e³)=3, ln(1)=logₑ(1)=0

Since the functions $f(x)=e^{.1}$ and g(x) = ln(x) are inverses of each other,

ln(eˣ) = x and eˡⁿˣ = x

and their graphs are symmetric about the line $y=X$ (Figure 1.46)

![](./images/fHrvHgL6cl9k2q2BMKYQqmiUhPdZ55A8H.png)
Figure 1.46 The functions $y=e^{X}$ and y = ln(x) are

inverses of each other, so their graphs are symmetric about the line $y=x$

At this site (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_logscale) you can see an example of a base-10 logarithmic scale

![](./images/fEh1dx51ZuwO54q8XEtnGExMk8evVgN5U.png)

In general, for any base $b>0$ . b≠1 the function g(x)=logբ(x) is symmetric about the line $y=x$ with the functior $f(x)=b^{x}$ Using this fact and the graphs of the exponential functions, we graph functions logb for several values of $b>1$ (Figure 1.47)

![](./images/fHc5mDIpTnpSBgCg39Nz1n9RrPWOIaWdS.png)
Figure 1.47 Graphs of y = logₓ(b) are depicted for

Before solving some equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions, let's review the basic properties of logarithms

# Rule: Properties of Logarithms

If a,b, $c>0$ b≠1 ， and $r$ is any real number, then

1. 2.
logₐ(ac)=logₐ(a)+logₐ(c) (Product property)
logₐ(a/c)=logₐ(a)-logₐ(c) (Quotient property)
logₐ(aʳ)=rlogₐ(a) (Power property)
3.

## Example 1.36

Solving Equations Involving Exponential Functions

Solve each of the following equations for X

a. $5^{x}=2$ b. $e^{x}+6e^{-x}=5$

### Solution

a.Applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation, we have

ln 5ˣ = ln 2

Using the power property of logarithms,

xln5=ln2

Therefore, x = ln2/ln5

b.Multiplying both sides of the equation by $e^{x}$ ,we arrive at the equation

$$e^{2x}+6=5e^{x}.$$

Rewriting this equation as

$$e^{2x}-5e^{x}+6=0,$$

we can then rewrite it as a quadratic equation in $e^{x}$

$$(e^x)^2-5(e^x)+6=0.$$

Now we can solve the quadratic equation.Factoring this equation,we obtain

$$(e^x-3)(e^x-2)=0.$$

Therefore, the solutions satisfy $e^{x}=3$ and $e^{x}=2$ .Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us the solutions x=ln3 ,ln2

![](./images/fWuERmabzx56ctBK8kBOSHeBA9c4fbgHL.png)

1.30 Solve $e^{2x}/(3+e^{2x})=1/2$

# Example 1.37

### Solving Equations Involving Logarithmic Functions

Solve each of the following equations for $X$

ln(1/X) = 4
b.log10vx + log10.x = 2 C. ln(2x) - 3ln(x²) = 0

### Solution

a.By the definition of the natural logarithm function

ln(1/x) = 4 iff e⁴ = 1/x

Therefore. the solution is $x=1/e^{4}$

b. Using the product and power properties of logarithmic functions, rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as

log₁₀√x+log₁₀x=log₁₀x√x=log₁₀x³/²=(3/2)log₁₀x.

Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as

(3/2)log₁₀x = 2 or log₁₀x = 4/3

The solution is x=10^(4/3)=10*∛10

C. Using the power property of logarithmic functions, we can rewrite the equation as ln(2x) - ln(x⁶) = 0 Using the quotient property, this becomes

ln(2/x⁵)=0.

Therefore, $2/x^{5}=1$ ，which implies x=∛2 We should then check for any extraneous solutions.

1.31 Solve 
ln(x³)-4ln(x)=1

When evaluating a logarithmic function with a calculator, you may have noticed that the only options are log₁₀ or log, called the common logarithm, or In, which is the natural logarithm. However, exponential functions and logarithm functions can be expressed in terms of any desired base $b$ .If you need to use a calculator to evaluate an expression with a different base, you can apply the change-of-base formulas first. Using this change of base, we typically write a given exponential or logarithmic function in terms of the natural exponential and natural logarithmic functions.

### Rule:Change-of-Base Formulas

Let $a>0$ a>0 $a>0,b>0$ b>0 $b>0$ and a≠1 b≠1 1. aˣ = bˣlogᵦᵃ for any real number $x$ If $b=e$ , this equation reduces to aˣ=eˣlna 2. logₐx = logₓx/logₓa for any real number $x>0$ If $b=e$ , this quation reduces to logₐx=ln x/ln a

### Proof

For the first change-of-base formula, we begin by making use of the power property of logarithmic functions. We know that for any base $b>0$ b≠1 ， logₐ(a^λ)=xloga . Therefore,

b^(logb(ax))=b^(xlogba)

In addition, we know that $b^{x}$ and logₓ(x) are inverse functions. Therefore

b<sup>log<sub>b</sub>(a<sup>x</sup>)</sup> = a<sup>x</sup>

Combinin he lat two equlies we concludethat 
aˣ = bˣlogb a 

To prove the second property, we show that

(logₐb)(logₓa) = logₓb

Let u = logₐb ν = logₐx and w = logₓb .We will show that ll⋅V=W .By the definition of logarithmic functions, we

know that $b^{u}=a$ ， aᵛ=x and $b^{w}=x$ From the previous equations,we see that

b<sup>uν</sup>=(b<sup>u</sup>)<sup>ν</sup>=a<sup>ν</sup>=x=b<sup>w</sup>

Therefore, $b^{m}=b^{w}$ .Since exponential functions are one-to-one, we can conclude that ll⋅V=W 口

# Example 1.38

## Changing Bases

Use a calculating utility to evaluate log₃7 with the change-of-base formula presented earlier

### Solution

Use the second equation with $a=3$ and $e=3$

log₃7 = ln 7 / ln 3 ≈ 1.77124

1.32 Use the change-of-base formula and a calculating utility to evaluate log₄6

Chapter Opener: The Richter Scale for Earthquakes

![](./images/fve0kCPyZHkubMWXCD4aUsmlvoTichE0x.png)
Figure 1.48 (credit: modification of work by Robb

Hannawacker, NPS)

In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the Richter scale) to measure the magnitude of an earthquake. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude $R_{1}$ on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude $R_{2}$ on the Richter scale.

Suppose $R_1>R_2$ , which means the earthquake of magnitude $R_{1}$ is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If $A_{1}$ is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and $A_2$ is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:

R₁ - R₂ = log₁₀(A₁/A₂)

Consider an earthquake that measures 8 on the Richter scale and an earthquake that measures 7 on the Richter scale. Then,

8-7=log₁₀(A₁/A₂).

Therefore,

log₁₀(A₁/A₂) = 1

which implies $A_{1}/A_{2}=10$ or $A_{1}=10A_{2}$ .Since $A_1$ is 10 times the size of $A_2$ ，we say that the first earthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equatior

log₁₀(A₁/A₂)=8-6=2

Therefore, $A_{1}=100A_{2}$ .That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second earthquake.

How can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9 earthquake in Japan ir 2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010

## Solution

To compare the Japan and Haiti earthquakes, we can use an equation presented earlier

9 - 7.3 = log₁₀(A₁/A₂)

Therefore, $A_{1}/A_{2}=10^{1.7}$ , and we conclude that the earthquake in Japan was approximately 50 times mon intense than the earthquake in Haiti

1.33Compare the relative severity of a magnitude 8.4 earthquake with a magnitude 7.4 earthquake

# Hyperbolic Functions

The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of certain combinations of $e^{X}$ and $e^{-x}$ These functions arise naturally in various engineering and physics applications, including the study of water waves and vibrations of elastic membranes. Another common use for a hyperbolic function is the representation of a hanging chain or cable, also known as a catenary (Figure 1.49). If we introduce a coordinate system so that the low point of the chain lies along the $y$ -axis, we can describe the height of the chain in terms of a hyperbolic function. First, we define the hyperbolic functions

![](./images/fugCWDalv2BL2sBggsi7TD5xcGCRWTn2q.png)
Figure 1.49 The shape of a strand of silk in a spider's web

can be described in terms of a hyperbolic function. The same shape applies to a chain or cable hanging from two supports with only its own weight. (credit: “Mtpaley”, Wikimedia Commons)

### Definition

Hyperbolic cosine|$cochr=e^{a}+e^{a}$
Hyperbolic sine|sin x
Hyperbolic tangent|tanh x=sinh x/sinh x cosh$x$
Hyperbolic cosecant|cschx S11
Hyperbolic secant|$sechx=$ coshx
Hyperbolic cotangent|$e^{x}+e^{-x}$ $cothr=coshx$
 |coth.x sinh x -1/2 = 1/2 $,-x$ e ½=½


The name cosh rhymes with “gosh,”whereas the name sinh is pronounced “cinch.” Tanh.sech,csch,and coth are pronounced "tanch," "seech," "coseech," and "cotanch," respectively

Using the definition of cosh(x) and principles of physics, it can be shown that the height of a hanging chain, such as the one in Fiqure 1.49,can be described by the function h（x)=acosh(x/a)+c for certain constants $a$ and $c$

But why are these functions called hyperbolic functions?To answer this question, consider the quantity cosh²t-sinh²t Using the definition of cosh and sinh.we see that

cosh²t - sinh²t = (e²ᵗ + 2 + e⁻²ᵗ)/4 - (e²ᵗ - 2 + e⁻²ᵗ)/4 = 1

This identity is the analog of the trigonometric identity cos²t+sin²t=1 .Here, given a value $t$ the poin $( x$, y = cosh t , sinht) lies on the unit hyperbola $x^{2}-y^{2}=1$ (Figure 1.50)

![](./images/f49h1t6A9BdGmTaV1mF64o3DxSFDkGZwg.png)

Figure 1.50 The unit hyperbola cosh²t-sinh²t=1

### Graphs of Hyperbolic Functions

To graph coshx and sinh.x, we make use of the fact that both functions approach $(1/2)e^x$ as x→∞ ， since e⁻ˣ→0 as x→∞ .As x→-∞ , coshx approaches $1/2e^{-x}$ ,whereas sinhx approaches $-1/2e^{-x}$ Therefore, using the graphs of $1/2e^x$ ， $1/2e^{-x}$ ，and $-1/2e^{-x}$ as guides, we graph coshx and sinh.x. To graph tanhx, we use the fact that tanh(0)=0 ， -1<tanh(x)<1 for all $x$, tanhx→1 as x→∞ ，and tanh x → -1 as x→-∞ .The graphs of the other three hyperbolic functions can be sketched using the graphs of cosh.x, sinh.x, and tanh.x (Figure 1.51).

$e^{-x}$

### Identities Involving Hyperbolic Functions

The identity cosh²t-sinh²t ,shown in Figure 1.50, is one of several identities involving the hyperbolic functions, some of which are listed next. The first four properties follow easily from the definitions of hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. Except for some differences in signs, most of these properties are analogous to identities for trigonometric functions.

### Rule: Identities Involving Hyperbolic Functions

1. cosh(-x) = cosh x 2. sinh(-x) = -sinh x 3. coshx+sinhx=eˣ 4.coshx-sinhx=e-x

5. cosh²x-sinh²x=1 6. 1-tanh²x = sech²x 7. cosh²x - 1 = cosh²x 8. sinh(x±y)=sinh x cosh y±cosh x sinh y 土± 9. cosh(x±y)= cosh.xcoshy ± sinhxsinhy

## Example 1.40

## Evaluating Hyperbolic Functions

a.Simplify sinh(5ln x) b.If sinh x=3/4 find the values of the remaining five hyperbolic functions.

### Solution

a.Using the definition of the sinh function, we write

sinh(5lnx)=(e^(5lnx)-e^(-5lnx))/2=(e^(ln(x⁵))-e^(ln(x⁻⁵)))/2=(x⁵-x⁻⁵)/2.

b.Using the identity cosh²x-sinh²x=1, we see that

cosh²x=1+(3/4)²=25/16

Since cosh x ≥ 1 for all $X$ we must have cosh x=5/4 .Then, using the definitions for the other hyperbolic functions, we conclude that  tanh x = 3/5  ,csch $x=4/3$ ,sech $x=4/5$ ，and coth x = 5/3

1.34Simplify cosh(2lnx)

### Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

From the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that all of them are one-to-one except cosh.x and sech.x. If we restrict the domains of these two functions to the interval [0,∞ ),then all the hyperbolic functions are one-to-one, and we can define the inverse hyperbolic functions. Since the hyperbolic functions themselves involve exponential functions, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve logarithmic functions.

sinh⁻¹x = arcsinhx = ln(x + √(x² + 1))  cosh⁻¹x = arccoshx = ln(x + √(x² - 1)) tanh⁻¹x = arctanhx = (1/2)ln((1 + x)/(1 - x)) coth⁻¹x = arccotx = (1/2)ln((x + 1)/(x - 1)) sech⁻¹x = arcsechx = ln((1 + √(1 - x²))/x) csch⁻¹x = arccschx = ln(1/x + √(1 + x²)/|x|)

Let's look at how to derive the first equation. The others follow similarly. Suppose y = sinh⁻¹x Then, x=sinh y and, by the defitiono the hyperbolie sine function, x=(e<sup>y</sup>-e<sup>-y</sup>)/2 Therefore

$$e^{y}-2x-e^{-y}=0.$$

Multiplying this equation by $e^{1}$ ，we obtain

$$e^{2y}-2xe^{y}-1=0.$$

This can be solved like a quadratic equation, with the solution

eʸ=(2x±√(4x²+4))/2=x±√(x²+1)

Since $e^{y}>0$ the only solution is the one with the positive sign. Applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the equation, we conclude that


y=ln(x+√(x²+1))

## Example 1.41

### Solution
sinh⁻¹(2) = ln(2 + √(2² + 1)) = ln(2 + √5) ≈ 1.4436, tanh⁻¹(1/4) = (1/2)ln((1 + 1/4)/(1 - 1/4)) = (1/2)ln(5/3) ≈ 0.2554

# KEY CONCEPTS

### 1.1 Review of Functions

·A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input ·If no domain is stated for a function $y=f(x)$ ，the domain is considered to be the set of all real numbers $X$ for which the function is defined. ·When sketching the graph of a function $f$ each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once. •A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, one y-intercept ·To define the composition g∘f ，the range of $f$ must be contained in the domain of $g$ •Even functions are symmetric about the $y$ -axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin

## 1.2 Basic Classes of Functions

n≠0 and it is an odd function if $n$ is odd ·The root function $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ has the domain [0, ∞ if $n$ is even and the domain (-∞), ∞ if $n$ is odd. If $n$ is odd, then $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ is an odd function ·The domain of the rational function $f(x)=p(x)/q(x)$ ，where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomial functions, is the set of X such that q(x)≠0 ·Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions are examples of transcendental functions ·A polynomial function $f$ with degree n ≥ 1 satisfies f(x)→±∞ as x → ±∞ .The sign of the output as x→∞ depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether $n$ is even or odd ·Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the $x-$ and $y$ -axes are examples of transformations of functions

2.1A Preview of Calculus 2.2 The Limit of a Function 2.3 The Limit Laws 2.4 Continuity 2.5 The Precise Definition of a Limit

## Introduction

Science fiction writers often imagine spaceships that can travel to far-off planets in distant galaxies. However, back in 1905, Albert Einstein showed that a limit exists to how fast any object can travel. The problem is that the faster an object moves, the more mass it attains (in the form of energy), according to the equation

m = m₀/√(1 - v²/c²)

where $m_{0}$ is the object's mass at rest, $V$ is its speed, and C is the speed of light. What is this speed limit? (We explore this problem further in Example 2.12.)

The idea of a limit is central to all of calculus. We begin this chapter by examining why limits are so important. Then, we go on to describe how to find the limit of a function at a given point. Not all functions have limits at all points, and we discuss what this means and how we can tell if a function does or does not have a limit at a particular value. This chapter has been created in an informal, intuitive fashion, but this is not always enough if we need to prove a mathematical statement involving limits. The last section of this chapter presents the more precise definition of a limit and shows how to prove whether a function has a limit.

# Learning Objectives

2.1.1Describe the tangent problem andhow it led to the idea ofa derivative. 2.1.2 Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the tangent problem 2.1.3Recognize a tangent toa curve at a point as the limit of secant lines. 2.1.4Identify instantaneousvelocity as the limit of average velocity over a smalltime interval 2.1.5Describe the area problem and how it was solvedby the integral 2.1.6Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the area problem. 2.1.7 Recognize how the ideas of limit,derivative,and integral led to the studies of infinite series and multivariable calculus.

As we embark on our study of calculus, we shall see how its development arose from common solutions to practical problems in areas such as engineering physics—like the space travel problem posed in the chapter opener. Two key problems led to the initial formulation of calculus: (1) the tangent problem, or how to determine the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point; and (2) the area problem, or how to determine the area under a curve.

# The Tangent Problem and Differential Calculus

Rate of change is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. We begin our investigation of rates of change by looking at the graphs of the three lines $f(x)=-2x-3$ ，g(x) =x+ 1, and $h(x)=2$ ，shown in Figure 2.2

![](./images/fpc3sHbfx3bYAGgeKRGrzCqKpGTBP6UWr.png)
Figure 2.2 The rate of change of a linear function is constant in each of these three graphs, with the constant determined by the

slope.

As we move from left to right along the graph of $f(x)=-2x-3$ ，we see that the graph decreases at a constant rate.For every 1 unit we move to the right along the $x$ axis, the y-coordinate decreases by 2 units. This rate of change is determined by the slope (-2) of the line. Similarly, the slope of 1/2 in the function $g(x)$ tells us that for every change in $x$ of 1 unit there is a corresponding change in $y$ of 1/2 unit. The function $h(x)=2$ has a slope of zero,indicating that the values of the function remain constant. We see that the slope of each linear function indicates the rate of change of the function.

Compare the graphs of these three functions with the graph of $k(x)=x^{2}$ (Figure 2.3). The graph of $k(x)=x^{2}$ starts from the left by decreasing rapidly, then begins to decrease more slowly and level off, and then finally begins to increase—slowly at first, followed by an increasing rate of increase as it moves toward the right. Unlike a linear function, no single number represents the rate of change for this function. We quite naturally ask: How do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function?

![](./images/f8TwfGY3KNRorFDF1xz83n7mt46uTudNw.png)
Figure 2.3 The function $k(x)=x^{2}$ does not have a constant

rate of change.

We can approximate the rate of change of a function $f(x)$ at a point (a, $f(a))$ on its graph by taking another point $( x$, $f( x) )$ on the graph of $f(x)$ , drawing a line through the two points, and calculating the slope of the resulting line. Such a line is called a secant line. Figure 2.4 shows a secant line to a function $f(x)$ at a point (a, $f(a)$

Figure 2.4 The slope of a secant line through a point

(a, $f(a))$ estimates the rate of change of the function at the point (a, $f(a)]$

### Definition

The secant to the function $f(x)$ through the points (a, $f(a))$ and $(x,f(x))$ is the line passing through these points. Its slope is given by

m_(sec)=(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)

The accuracy of approximating the rate of change of the function with a secant line depends on how close $X$ is to $a$ .As we see in Figure 2.5,if $X$ is closer to $a$ , the slope of the secant line is a better measure of the rate of change of $f(x)$ at a.

![](./images/fh1GWtyDLcROLDg1TyO93UMt9nvA3PkY7.png)
Figure 2.5 As $x$ gets closer to $a$ , the slope of the secant line

becomes a better approximation to the rate of change of the function $f(x)$ at a.

The secant lines themselves approach a line that is called the tangent to the function $f(x)$ at α (Figure 2.6). The slope of the tangent line to the graph at a measures the rate of change of the function at $a$ . This value also represents the derivative of the function $f(x)$ at $a$ , or the rate of change of the function at $a$ . This derivative is denoted by f'(a) . Differential calculus is the field of calculus concerned with the study of derivatives and their applications.

Figure 2.6Solving the Tangent Problem: As $x$ approaches a,

the secant lines approach the tangent line.

Example 2.1 illustrates how to find slopes of secant lines. These slopes estimate the slope of the tangent line or, equivalently, the rate of change of the function at the point at which the slopes are calculated.

### Example 2.1

### Finding Slopes of Secant Lines

Estimate the slope of the tangent line (rate of change) to $f(x)=x^{2}$ at $x=1$ by finding slopes of secant lines through (1, 1) and each of the following points on the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}$

a.(2, 4) b. (3/2, 9/4)

### Solution

Use the formula for the slope of a secant line from the definition
a. m_sec = (4 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 3, b. m_sec = (9/4 - 1)/(3/2 - 1) = 5/2 = 2.5

The point in part b. is closer to the point (1, 1), so the slope of 2.5 is closer to the slope of the tangent line. A good estimate for the slope of the tangent would be in the range of 2 to 2.5 (Figure 2.7)

lines through (1, 1) and the point (5/4, 25/16) on the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}$

We continue our investigation by exploring a related question. Keeping in mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate of change of position, suppose that we have a function, $s(t)$ ，that gives the position of an object along a coordinate axis at any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given time $t=a$ ? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an average velocity. First, recall that the speed of an object traveling at a constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has traveled. We define the average velocity of an object over a time period to be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.

## Definition

Let $s(t)$ be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at time t. The average velocity of the object over a time interval $[a,t]$ where $a<t$ (or [t, a] if $t<a$ is

ν_ave = (s(t)-s(a))/(t-a)

As $t$ is chosen closer to $a$ ,the average velocity becomes closer to the instantaneous velocity. Note that finding the average velocity of a position function over a time interval is essentially the same as finding the slope of a secant line to a function. Furthermore, to find the slope of a tangent line at a point $a$ , we let the $x$ -values approach $a$ in the slope of the secant line. Similarly, to find the instantaneous velocity at time $a$ , we let the t-values approach $a$ in the average velocity. This process of letting $x$ or $t$ approach a in an expression is called taking a limit. Thus, we may define the instantaneous velocity as follows.

## Definition

For a position function $s(t)$ ,the instantaneous velocity at a time $t=a$ is the value that the average velocities approach on intervals of the form [α, t] and [t, a] as the values of t become closer to $a$ , provided such a value exists.

Example 2.2 illustrates this concept of limits and average velocity,

# Example 2.2

# Finding Average Velocity

A rock is dropped from a height of 64 ft. It is determined that its height (in feet) above ground t seconds later (fon 0≤t≤2 is given by $s(t)=-16t^{2}+64$ .Find the average velocity of the rock over each of the given time intervals. Use this information to guess the instantaneous velocity of the rock at time $t=0.5$

a.[0.49, 0.5] b.[0.5, 0.51]

## Solution

Substitute the data into the formula for the definition of average velocity.

ν_ave = (s(0.5)-s(0.49))/(0.5-0.49) = -15.84

b.  ν_ave = (s(0.51) - s(0.5))/(0.51 - 0.5) = -16.16

The instantaneous velocity is somewhere between 15.84 and 16.16 ft/sec. A good guess might be -16 ft/sec

2.2 An object moves along a coordinate axis so that its position at time $t$ is given by $s(t)=t^{3}$ Estimate its instantaneous velocity at time $t=2$ by computing its average velocity over the time interval [2, 2.001]

## The Area Problem and Integral Calculus.

We now turn our attention to a classic question from calculus. Many quantities in physicsfor example, quantities of work—may be interpreted as the area under a curve. This leads us to ask the question: How can we find the area between the graph of a function and the $x$ -axis over an interval (Figure 2.8)?

![](./images/feHAwnX9CPOgGIrWh7EK5sv7zNEwgx9lY.png)

Figure 2.8 The Area Problem: How do we find the area of the shaded region?

As in the answer to our previous questions on velocity, we first try to approximate the solution. We approximate the area by dividing up the interval $[a,b]$ into smaller intervals in the shape of rectangles. The approximation of the area comes from addingup the areas of these rectangles(Figure 2.9)

![](./images/fGr8RiauOzp65gzNHFUa5TLbGBpdZV2L0.png)
Fiqure 2.9The area of theregion under the curve is

approximated by summing the areas of thin rectangles.

As the widths of the rectangles become smaller (approach zero), the sums of the areas of the rectangles approach the area between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x$ -axis over the interval [a, b]. Once again, we find ourselves taking a limit. Limits of this type serve as a basis for the definition of the definite integral. Integral calculus is the study of integrals and their applications

# Example 2.3

## Estimation Using Rectangles

Estimate the area between the $x$ axis and the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ over the interval [0, 3] by using the three rectangles shown in Figure 2.10.

![](./images/fgHE31BNUd9b4Bdfkkm9hwgOCwObDoMO8.png)

$$f(x)=x^2+1$$

Figure 2.10 The area of the region under the curve of

$f(x)=x^{2}+1$ can be estimated using rectangles.

### Solution

The areas of the three rectangles are 1 unit’, 2 unit$^2$ , and 5 unit?. Using these rectangles, our area estimate is 8 unit².

2.3Estimate the area between the $x$ -axis and the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ over the interval [0, 3] by using the three rectangles shown here:

![](./images/fZSSNYL3m3xbyX7wZs08f9DxVeUQ1dgDm.png)

$$f(x)=x^2+1$$

# Other Aspects of Calculus

So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can be represented visually using graphs in two dimensions; however, there is no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for example, that instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a rock fired from a catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We might want to graph real-value functions of two variables or determine volumes of solids of the type shown in Figure 2.11. These are only a few of the types of questions that can be asked and answered using multivariable calculus. Informally, multivariable calculus can be characterized as the study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However, before exploring these and other ideas, we must first lay a foundation for the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit

![](./images/fZVdCVKiUW2LaL9Py92Voi7nv5YiywOmM.png)

Figure 2.11We canuse multivariable calculus to find the volume between a surface defined by a function of two variables and a plane.

# 2.2I The Limit of aFunction

# Learning Objectives

2.2.1 Using correct notation, describe the limit of a function

2.2.2Use a table of values to estimate thelimit of a function or to identify when the limit does not exist. 2.2.3 Use a graph to estimate the limit of a function or to identify when the limit does not exist. 2.2.4 Define one-sided limits and provide examples 2.2.5 Explain the relationship between one-sided and two-sided limits. 2.2.6 Using correct notation, describe an infinite limit. 2.2.7 Define a vertical asymptote

The concept of a limit or limiting process, essential to the understanding of calculus, has been around for thousands of years. In fact, early mathematicians used a limiting process to obtain better and better approximations of areas of circles. Yet, the formal definition of a limit—as we know and understand it today—did not appear until the late 19th century. We therefore begin our quest to understand limits, as our mathematical ancestors did, by using an intuitive approach. At the end of this chapter, armed with a conceptual understanding of limits, we examine the formal definition of a limit.

We begin our exploration of limits by taking a look at the graphs of the functions

f(x)=(x²-4)/(x-2), g(x)=|x-2|/(x-2), and h(x)=1/(x-2)²,

which are shown in Figure 2.12. In particular, let's focus our attention on the behavior of each graph at and around $x=2$

![](./images/fS74N4kTF3kQX3D845sUOw9g1t93GXbgi.png)
Figure 2.12These graphs show the behavior of three different functions around $x=2$

Each of the three functions is undefined at $x=2$ but if we make this statement and no other,we give a very incomplete picture of how each function behaves in the vicinity of $x=2$ .To express the behavior of each graph in the vicinity of 2 more completely, we need to introduce the concept of a limit.

# Intuitive Definition of a Limit

Let's first take a closer look at how the function f(x) = (x² 4)/(x - 2) behaves around $x=2$ in Figure2.12.As the values of $X$ approach 2 from either side of 2, the values of $y=f(x)$ approach 4.Mathematically,we say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $X$ approaches 2 is 4. Symbolically, we express this limit as

lim_(x→2)f(x)=4

From this very brief informal look at one limit, let's start to develop an intuitive definition of the limit. We can think of the limit of a function at a number α as being the one real number $L$ that the functional values approach as the $x$ values approach $a$ , provided such a real number $L$ exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following definition:

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at al values in an open interval containing U , with the possible exception of $a$ itself, and let $L$ be a real number. If all values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of x(≠a) approach the number $a$ , then we say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $X$ approaches $a$ is $L$ - (More succinct, as $x$ gets closer to $a$ $f(x)$ gets closer and stays close to $L$ .) Symbolically, we express this idea as

limₓ→ₐf(x) = L.

We can estimate limits by constructing tables of functional values and by looking at their graphs. This process is described in the following Problem-Solving Strategy

# Problem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values

1. To evaluate lim_(x→a)f(x) . we begin by completing a table of functional values. We should choose two sets of x-values-one set of values approaching a and less than a, and another set of values approaching α and greater than a. Table 2.1 demonstrates what your tables might look like.


$X$|$f(x)$|$X$|$f(x)$
$a-0.1$|$f(a-0.1)$|$a+0.1$|$f(a+0.1)$
$a-0.01$|$f(a-0.01)$|$a+0.01$|$f(a+0.01)$
$a-0.001$|$f(a-0.001)$|$a+0.001$|$f(a+0.001)$
$a-0.0001$|$f(a-0.0001)$|$a+0.0001$|$f(a+0.0001)$
|Use additional values as necessary.| |l values as necessary. Use additional values as necessary

Table 2.1 Table of Functional Values for lim_(x→a)f(x)

2. Next, let's look at the values in each of the $f(x)$ columns and determine whether the values seem to be approaching a single value as we move down each column. In our columns, we look at the sequence and and $f(a-0.1)$ $f(a-0.01)$ ， $f(a-0.001)$ " $f(a-0.0001)$ S0 on, $f(a+0.1)$ $f(a+0.01)$ ， $f(a+0.001)$ ， $f(a+0.0001)$ .and so on. (Note: Although we have chosen the $x$ -values 
a ± 0.1  a ± 0.01  a±0.001 ， a±0.0001 ,and so forth, and these values will probably work nearly every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify our choices.) 3. If both columns approach a common y-value $L$ westate limₓ→ₐf(x) = L .. We can use the following strategy to confirm theresult obtained from the table or as an alternative method for estimating alimit

4. Using a graphing calculator or computer software that allows us graph functions, we can plot the function $f(x)$ ,making sure the functional values of $f(x)$ for $X$ values near a are in our window. We can use the trace feature to move along the graph of the function and watch the $y$ -value readout as the $X$ -values approach a. If the y-values approach $L$ as our $X$ -values approach a from both directions, then limₓ→ₐf(x) = L .. We may need to zoom in on our graph and repeat this process several times.

We apply this Problem-Solving Strategy to compute a limit in Example 2.4.

## Example 2.4

Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values 1

Evaluate lim_(x→0) sin x/x using atable of functional ales

### Solution

We have calculated the values of f(x)=(sin x)/x for the values of $x$ listed in Table 2.2


$x$|sin x $x$|$X$|sin x x⁻
-0.1|0.998334166468|0.1|0.998334166468
-0.01|0.99998333417|0.01|0.99998333417

Table 2.2 Tableof Funtonl Value for lim_(x→0) sin x/x

Note: The values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator output.

As we read down each (sin x)/x column, we se that the alues in each column appear to be approaching one Thus, it is fairly reasonableto conclude that lim(x→0) sin x/x = 1 . A calculator or computer-generated graph off f(x) = (sin x)/x would be similar to that shown in Figure 2.13, and it confirms our estimate

![](./images/fE0scHDlIIq3tXbRDvVSdgoLa0ccdADqE.png)

Figure 2.13 The graph of f(x)=(sin x)/x confirms the estimate from Table 2.2

## Example 2.5

Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values 2

Evaluate lim(x→4)(√x-2)/(x-4) using tbleof funtional values

### Solution

As before, we use a table—in this case, Table 2.3to list the values of the function for the given values of $x$

$X$|$√x-2 x-4$|$X$|$√x-2 x-4$<br>
3.9|0.251582341869|4.1|0.248456731317<br>
3.99|0.25015644562|4.01|0.24984394501<br>

3.99999|0.25000016|4.00001|0.24999984<br>

Table 2.3

Table of Functional Values for lim(x→4)(√x-2)/(x-4)

After inspecting this table, we see that the functional values less than 4 appear to be decreasing towarc 0.25 whereas the functional values greater than 4 appear to be increasing toward 0.25. We conclude that

![](./images/fHGGXdS9OACspktytMPAYp1fiWr3llmuo.png)

![](./images/fgbIoHgcMHUB2weLKGbWqNBbAFQSrWTZI.png)

lim_(x→1)(1/x-1)/(x-1) using tableof functionl values use rahto cofim your estimate

At this point, we see from Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 that it may be just as easy, if not easier, to estimate a limit of a function by inspecting its graph as it is to estimate the limit by using a table of functional values. In Example 2.6, we evaluate a limit exclusively by looking at a graph rather than by using a table of functional values.

## Example 2.6

Evaluating a Limit Using a Graph

For $g(x)$ shown in Figure 2.15, evaluate lim_(x→-1)g(x)

![](./images/fvLuhgLx7BGuKX2VfCMxsl299A3dim39t.png)
Figure 2.15The graph of $g(x)$ includes one value not on a

smooth curve

### Solution

Despite the fact that $g(-1)=4$ ，as the $x$ -values approach -1 from either side, the $g(x)$ values approach 3. Therefore, lim_(x→-1)g(x) = 3 . Note that we can determine this limit without even knowing the algebraic expression

of the function.

Based on Example 2.6, we make the following observation: It is possible for the limit of a function to exist at a point, and for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit of the function and the value of the function at the point may be different.

2.5 Use the graph of $h(x)$ in Figure 2.16 to evaluatelim /(x),if possible.

Figure 2.16

Looking at a table of functional values or looking at the graph of a function provides us with useful insight into the value of the limit of a function at a given point. However, these techniques rely too much on guesswork. We eventually need to develop alternative methods of evaluating limits. These new methods are more algebraic in nature and we explore them in the next section:however, at this point we introduce two special limits that are foundational to the techniques to come

## Theorem 2.1: Two Important Limits

Let a be a real number and $c$ be a constant.

i. lim_(x→a)x=a, ii. lim_(x→a)c=c

We can make the following observations about these twolimits.

i. For the first limit, observe that as $x$ approaches a, so does $f(x)$ .because $f(x)=x$ . Consequently, lim_(x→a)x=a

ii.For the second limit, consider Table 2.4

![](./images/frL7Mv6nwE8N7CETst5ZaxblT83RmZFLU.png)

Table 2.4 Table of Functional Values for lim_(x→a)c=c

Observe that for all values of $X$ (regardless of whether they are approaching a), the values $f(x)$ remain constant at c. We have no choice but to conclude lim_(x→a)c = 0

### The Existence of a Limit

As we consider the limit in the next example, keep in mind that for the limit of a function to exist at a point, the functional values must approach a single real-number value at that point. If the functional values do not approach a single value, then the limit does not exist.

### Example 2.7

Evaluating a Limit That Fails to Exist

Evaluate lim_(x→0)sin(1/x) using a table of values.

### Solution

Table 2.5 lists values for the function sin(1/x) for the given values of $x$


$X$|$sin(1/x)$|$X$|$sin(1/x)$<br>
-0.1|0.544021110889|0.1|-0.544021110889<br>
-0.01|0.50636564111|0.01|-0.50636564111<br>
-0.001|-0.8268795405312|0.001|0.826879540532<br>

-0.00001|-0.035748797987|0.00001|0.035748797987<br>
-0.000001|0.349993504187|0.00001|-0.349993504187<br>

Table 2.5

Table of Functional Values for 
lim_(x→0)sin(1/x)

After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the $y$ values do not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let's take a more systematic approach. Take the following sequence of $x$ -values approaching 0

2/π, 2/(3π), 2/(5π), 2/(7π), 2/(9π), 2/(11π), ...

The corresponding y-values are

1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...

At this point we can indeed conclude that lim_(x→0)sin(1/x) does not exist. (Mathematicians frequently abbreviate

"does not exist" as DNE. Thus, we would write lim_(x→0)sin(1/x) DNE.) The graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) is shown in Figure 2.17 and it gives a clearer picture of the behavior of sin(1/x) as $X$ approaches 0. You can see that sin(1/x) oscillates ever more wildly between -1 and 1 as $x$ approaches 0.

Figure 2.17 The graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly

between -1 and 1 as $x$ approaches 0.

2.6 Use a table of unctioal vale to valatea lim_(x→2)|x²-4|/(x-2) .if posile

## One-Sided Limits

Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not provide us with enough information about the behavior of the function at that particular point. To see this, we now revisit the function $g(x)=|x-2|/(x-2)$ introduced at the beginning of the section (see Figure 2.12(b)). As we pick values of $X$ close to 2, $g(x)$ does not approach a single value, so the limit as $X$ approaches 2 does not existthat is,  lim_(x→2) g(x)  DNE. However, this statement alone does not give us a complete picture of the behavior of the function around the $X$ -value 2. To provide a more accurate description, we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit.For all values to the left of 2 (or the negative side of 2), $g(x)=-1$ .Thus, as $X$ approaches 2 from the left, $g(x)$ approaches -1 Mathematically, we say that the limit as $X$ approaches 2 from the left is -1 Symbolically, we express this idea as
lim_(x→2⁻)g(x)=-1

Similarly, as $X$ approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), $g(x)$ approaches 1. Symbolically, we express this idea as

lim_(x→2⁺)g(x)=1.

We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits

### Definition

We define two typesof one-sided limits.

Limit from the left: Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (c, a), and let $L$ be a real number. If the values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of $X$ (where $x<a$ ）approach the number $a$ ,then we say that $L$ is the limit of $f(x)$ as $X$ approaches a from the left.Symbolically,we express this idea as

limₓ→ₐ⁻f(x)=L

Limit from the right:Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $(a,c)$ ，and let $L$ be a real number. If the values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number L as the values of $X$ (where $x>a$ ) approach the number $a$ , then we say that $L$ is the limit of $f(x)$ as $X$ approaches $a$ from the right. Symbolically, we express this idea as

lim_(x→a⁺)f(x)=L

### Example 2.8

a. lim<sub>x→2⁻</sub>f(x)
b. lim<sub>x→2⁺</sub>f(x)

### Solution

We can use tables of functional values again Table 2.6. Observe that for values of $x$ less than 2, we use $f(x)=x+1$ and for values of $x$ greater than 2, we use $f(x)=x^{2}-4$


$X$|$f(x)=x+1$|$x$|$f(x)=x^{2}-4$<br>
1.9|2.9|2.1|0.41<br>
1.99|2.99|2.01|0.0401<br>
1.999|2.999|2.001|0.004001<br>
1.9999|2.9999|2.0001|0.00040001<br>
1.99999|2.99999|2.00001|0.0000400001<br>

Table 2.6

Tabeof uncioalale fore f(x)={x+1; x²-4} $x<2$ #2 x≥2

Based on this table, we can conclude that a. lim_(x→2⁻)f(x)=3 and b. 
lim(x→2⁺) f(x) = 0 . Therefore, the (two-sided) limit of $f(x)$ does not exist at $x=2$ .Figure 2.18 shows a graph of $f(x)$ and reinforces our conclusion about these limits.

Figure 2.18 The grphoe f(x)={x+1 if x<2, x²-4 if x≥2} $x<2$ x≥2 has a

2.7Use a table of functional values to estimate the following limits,if possible.

![](./images/ficxwAtggWUnkhqcgzww1L7Cr4XhnDue3.png)

limₓ→₂⁻|x² - 4|/(x - 2), limₓ→₂⁺|x² - 4|/(x - 2)

Let us now consider the relationship between the limit of a function at a point and the limits from the right and left at that point. It seems clear that if the limit from the right and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value is the limit of the function at that point. Similarly, if the limit from the left and the limit from the right take on different values, the limit of the function does not exist. These conclusions are summarized in Relating One-Sided and TwoSided Limits.

### Theorem 2.2: Relating One-Sided and Two-Sided Limits

Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the possible exception of $a$ itself and let $L$ be a real number. Then.

limₓ→ₐf(x) = L. if and only if lim_(x→a⁻) f(x) = L and lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) = L

# Infinite Limits

Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from the right and left at a point helps us to characterize the behavior of a function around a given value. As we shall see, we can also describe the behavior of functions that do not have finite limits

We now turn our attention to $h(x)=1/(x-2)^{2}$ ,the third and final function introduced at the beginning of this section (see Figure 2.12(c)).From its graph we see that as the values of $X$ approach 2, the values of $h(x)=1/(x-2)^2$ become larger and larger and, in fact, become infinite. Mathematically, we say that the limit of $h(x)$ as $X$ approaches 2 is positive infinity, Symbolically,we express this idea as

lim<sub>x→2</sub>h(x)=+∞

More generally,we define infinite limits as follows

## Definition

We define three types of infinite limits.

Infinite limits from the left: Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $( b$, $a)$

i. If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $X$ (where $x<a$ )approach the number a, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches d from the left is positive infinity and we write

lim_(x→a⁻)f(x)=+∞

ii.If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of $X$ (where $x<a$ ）approach the number a,then we say that the limit as $X$ approaches $a$ from the left is negative infinity and we write

lim<sub>x→a⁻</sub>f(x) = -∞.

Infinite limits from the right: Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (a, c)

i.If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $X$ (where $x>a$ ）approach the number a,then we say that the limit as $X$ approaches $a$ from the right is positive infinity and we write

lim_(x→a⁺)f(x) = +∞

ii.If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of X (where $X>a$ ) approach the number $a$ then we say that the limit as $X$ approaches a from the right is negative infinity and we write

lim_(x→a⁺)f(x)=-∞

Two-sided infinite limit: Let $f(x)$ be defined for all x≠a in an open interval containing U

i.If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $X$ (where x≠a ）approach the number a, then we say that the limit as $X$ approaches $a$ is positive infinity and we write

lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞.

i.If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of $X$ (where x≠a ）approach the number $a$ ,then we say that the limit as $X$ approaches U is negative infinity and we write

lim_(x→a)f(x)=-∞

 It is important to understand that when we write statements such as lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞ or lim_(x→a) f(x) = -∞ we are describing the behavior of the function, as we have just defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the limit of a function $f(x)$ to exist at $a$ , it must approach a real number $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ . That said, if, for example, lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞ we always write lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞ rather than lim_(x→a)f(x) DNE

## Example 2.9

### Recognizing an Infinite Limit

Evaluate each of the following limits, if possible. Use a table of functional values and graph $f(x)=1/x$ to confirm your conclusion

a. limₓ→₀⁻1/x, b. limₓ→₀⁺1/x, c. limₓ→₀⁻1/x

### Solution

Begin by constructing a table of functional values.


$x$|$1/x$|$X$|$1/x$<br>
-0.1|-10|0.1|10<br>
-0.01|-100|0.01|100<br>
-0.001|-1000|0.001|1000<br>
-0.0001|-10,000|0.0001|10,000<br>
-0.00001|-100,000|0.00001|100,000<br>
-0.000001|-1,000,000|0.000001|1,000,000<br>

Table 2.7

Table of Functional Values for f(x) = 1/x

a.The values of $1/x$ decrease without bound as $x$ approaches O from the left. We conclude thar

lim<sub>x→0⁻</sub>1/x=-∞

b.The values of $1/x$ increase without bound as $x$ approaches 0 from the right. We conclude tha

lim(x→0⁺)1/x=+∞.

c.Since lim_(x→0⁻)1/x = -∞ and lim_(x→0⁺) 1/x = +∞ have different value, we concludethat

lim_(x→0)1/x DNE

The graph of $f(x)=1/x$ in Figure 2.19 confirms these conclusions.

![](./images/fPkbSfwIyVfRs5mU7ZkRMOpZX6mMbtXVf.png)
Figure 2.19 The graph of $f(x)=1/x$ confirms that the limit

as $x$ approaches 0 does not exist

 2.8Evaluate each of the following limits, if possible. Use a table of functional values and graph $f(x)=1/x^{2}$ to confirm your conclusion.

a. lim_(x→0⁻)1/x²  b. lim_(x→0⁺)1/x²  c. lim_(x→0)1/x²

It is useful to point out that functions of the form $f(x)=1/(x-a)^n$ ,where n is a positive integer, have infinite limits as x approaches α from either the left or right (Figure 2.20). These limits are summarized in Infinite Limits from Positive Integers.

![](./images/fhsix0ghFVHxN4Olp5pIN4Vcgq5oBIGii.png)
Figure 2.20 The function $f(x)=1/(x-a)^n$ has infinite limits at a.

### Theorem 2.3: Infinite Limits from Positive Integers

If $n$ is a positive even integer, then

lim_(x→a)1/(x-a)^n=+∞

If n is a positive odd integer, then

lim_(x→a⁺)1/((x-a)ⁿ)=+∞

limₓ→ₐ⁻1/(x-a)ⁿ=-∞

and

We should also point out that in the graphs of $f(x)=1/(x-a)^n$ points on the graph having $x$ -coordinates very near to α are very close to the vertical line $x=a$ . That is, as $x$ approaches $a$ , the points on the graph of $f(x)$ are closer to the line $x=a$ . The line $x=a$ is called a vertical asymptote of the graph. We formally define a vertical asymptote as follows:

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be a function. If any of the following conditions hold, then the line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote of $f(x)$

lim_(x→a⁻)f(x)=+∞ or -∞, lim_(x→a⁺)f(x) =+∞ or -∞, or lim_(x→a)f(x) =+∞ or -∞

## Example 2.10

### Finding a Vertical Asymptote

Evaluate each of the following limits using Infinite Limits from Positive Integers. Identify any vertical asymptotes of the function $f(x)=1/(x+3)^{4}$

a. lim_(x→-3⁻)1/(x+3)⁴, b. lim_(x→-3⁺)1/(x+3)⁴, c. lim_(x→-3)1/(x+3)⁴

### Solution

We can use Infinite Limits from Positive Integers directly.
a. lim_(x→-3⁻) 1/(x+3)⁴ = +∞, b. lim_(x→-3⁺) 1/(x+3)⁴ = +∞, c. lim_(x→-3) 1/(x+3)⁴ = +∞

The function $f(x)=1/(x+3)^{4}$ has a vertical asymptote of $x=-3$

2.9 E alateacho thefolwin limis denf na vetialasypte o he untionr f(x)=1/(x-2)³

a. lim_(x→2⁻)1/(x-2)³  b. lim_(x→2⁺)1/(x-2)³  c. lim_(x→2)1/(x-2)³

In the next example we put our knowledge of various types of limits to use to analyze the behavior of a function at several different points.

### Example 2.11

### Behavior of a Function at Different Points

Use the graph of $f(x)$ in Figure 2.21 to determine each of the following values:

lim_(x→-4⁻)f(x); lim_(x→-4⁺)f(x); lim_(x→-4)f(x); f(-4)

lim_(x→-2⁻)f(x); lim_(x→-2⁺)f(x); lim_(x→-2)f(x); f(-2)  lim_(x→1⁻)f(x); lim_(x→1⁺)f(x); lim_(x→1)f(x); f(1)  lim_(x→3⁻)f(x); lim_(x→3⁺)f(x); lim_(x→3)f(x); f(3)

![](./images/fwFMYILFYv2ZzbNVDG1EAXHhNUVMmvl5G.png)
Figure 2.21 The graph shows $f(x)$

### Solution

Using Infinite Limits from Positive Integers and the graph for reference, we arrive at the following values:
lim_(x→-4⁻)f(x)=0; lim_(x→-4⁺)f(x)=0; lim_(x→-4)f(x)=0; f(-4)=0

a. b. lim(x→-2⁻)f(x)=3; lim(x→-2⁺)f(x)=3; lim(x→-2)f(x)=3; f(-2) f(-2) $f(-2)$ is undefined
lim_(x→1⁻)f(x)=6; lim_(x→1⁺)f(x)=3; lim_(x→1)f(x) DNE; f(1)=6
d. lim(x→3⁻)f(x) = -∞; lim(x→3⁺)f(x) = -∞ limₓ→₃f(x) = -∞; f(3) is undefined

2.10 Evaluate limₓ→₁ f(x) for $f(x)$ shown here:

# Example 2.12

### Chapter Opener: Einstein's Equation

![](./images/feGMs6Y0xfrrvHhgbkGSdakyBukDKpDgs.png)
Figure 2.22 (credit: NASA)

In the chapter opener we mentioned briefly how Albert Einstein showed that a limit exists to how fast any object can travel. Given Einstein's equation for the mass of a moving object, what is the value of this bound

### Solution

Our starting point is Einstein’s equation for the mass of a moving object

m=m₀/√(1-y²/c²)

where m。is the object's mass at rest. $V$ is its speed, and L is the speed of light. To see how the mass changes a high speeds, we can graph the ratio of masses $m/m_0$ as a function of the ratio of speeds, v/c (Figure 2.23)

![](./images/f99AGdpDwyAtOZoilMmMS3TDOd3HrG40v.png)
Figure 2.23 This graph shows the ratio of masses as a

function of the ratio of speeds in Einstein’s equation for the mass of a moving object.

We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1—that is,as the speed of the object approaches the speee of light—the ratio of masses increases without bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at $v/c=1$ .We can try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.


v/c|||A||₁ 111|$m/m_0$<br>
0.99|0.1411|7.089<br>
0.999|0.0447|22.37<br>
0.9999|0.0141|70.71<br>


Table 2.8 Ratio of Masses and Speeds for a Moving Object

Thus, according to Table 2.8, if an object with mass 100 kg is traveling at $0.9999c$ , its mass becomes 7071 kg Since no object can have an infinite mass, we conclude that no object can travel at or more than the speed of light

# 2.3 | The Limit Laws

# Learning Objectives

2.3.1 Recognize the basiclimit laws.

2.3.2 Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a function. 2.3.3 Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring 2.3.4Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a polynomial or rational function 2.3.5Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring or byusing conjugates. 2.3.6Evaluate the limit of a function by using the squeeze theorem.

In the previous section, we evaluated limits by looking at graphs or by constructing a table of values. In this section, we establish laws for calculating limits and learn how to apply these laws. In the Student Project at the end of this section, you have the opportunity to apply these limit laws to derive the formula for the area of a circle by adapting a method devised by the Greek mathematician Archimedes. We begin by restating two useful limit results from the previous section. These two results, together with the limit laws, serve as a foundation for calculating many limits.

# Evaluating Limits with the Limit Laws

The first two limit laws were stated in Two Important Limits and we repeat them here. These basic results, together with the other limit laws, allow us to evaluate limits of many algebraic functions

### Theorem 2.4: Basic Limit Results

For any real number a and any constant c,

limx=α Jimc = c

## Example 2.13

Evaluating a Basic Limit

Evaluate each of the following limitsusingBasic Limit Results

a lim<sub>x→2</sub>x b. limm.5

### Solution

a.The limit of $x$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $a$ : lim_(x→2)x=2 b. The limit of a constant is that constant: lim_(x→2)5=5

We now take a look at the limit laws. the individual properties of limits.The proofs that these laws hold are omitted here

### Theorem 2.5: Limit Laws

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be defined for all x≠a over some open interval containing a. Assume that $L$ and $M$ are real numbers such that limₓ→ₐf(x) = L and lim_(x→a)g(x)=M Let C be a constant Then, each of the following statements holds:

limₓ→ₐ(f(x) + g(x)) = limₓ→ₐf(x) + limₓ→ₐg(x) = L + M

Difference law for limits: lim_(x→a)(f(x) - g(x)) = lim_(x→a)f(x) - lim_(x→a)g(x) = L - M

Constant multiple law for limits: lim_(x→a) cf(x) = c·lim_(x→a) f(x) = cL

Product law for limits: limx→a(f(x)⋅g(x)) = limx→a f(x) ⋅ limx→a g(x) = L⋅M

Quotiet n fo linits s lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x)=lim_(x→a)f(x)/lim_(x→a)g(x)=L/M for M ≠ 0 Power law for limits: lim<sub>x→a</sub>(f(x))ⁿ = (lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x))ⁿ = Lⁿ for every positiv integer n

Root law for limits: lim_(x→a)ⁿ√f(x)=ⁿ√(lim_(x→a)f(x))=ⁿ√L for all $L$ if TI is odd and for L ≥ 0 if $n$ is even and f(x)≥0

We now practice applying these limit laws to evaluate a limit

### Example 2.14

Evaluating a Limit Using Limit Laws.

Use the limit laws to evaluate limx→−3(4x+2)

### Solution

Let's apply the limit laws one step at a time to be sure we understand how they work. We need to keep in mind the requirement that, at each application of a limit law, the new limits must exist for the limit law to be applied
lim_(x→-3)(4x+2) = 4*lim_(x→-3)x + lim_(x→-3)2

### Example 2.15

Using Limit Laws Repeatedly

USseth imi ts t alate limₓ→₂ (2x² - 3x + 1)/(x³ + 4)

### Solution

To find this limit, we need to apply the limit laws several times. Again, we need to keep in mind that as we rewrite the limit in terms of other limits, each new limit must exist for the limit law to be applied

![](./images/fYfkI6buWgFT2c8RNlwIFn6gKPb1ghmp0.png)

 2.11 Use the limit laws to evaluate lim_(x→6) (2x - 1)√(x + 4) In each step, indiate the limit law apied

## Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions

By now you have probably noticed that, in each of the previous examples, it has been the case that lim_(x→a)f(x)=f(a) .This is not always true, but it does hold for all polynomials for any choice of a and for all rational functions at all values of $a$ for which the rational function is defined

### Theorem 2.6: Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions

Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be polynomial functions. Let a be a real number. Then.

lim_(x→a)p(x)=p(a)

lim_(x→a) p(x)/q(x) = p(a)/q(a) when q(a) ≠ 0

To see that this theorem holds, consider the polynomial p(x) = cₙxⁿ + cₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + c₁x + c₀ By applying the sum, constant multiple, and power laws, we end up with

lim<sub>x→a</sub>p(x) = lim<sub>x→a</sub>(c<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + c<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + c₁x + c₀) = c<sub>n</sub>(lim<sub>x→a</sub>x)<sup>n</sup> + c<sub>n-1</sub>(lim<sub>x→a</sub>x)<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + c₁(lim<sub>x→a</sub>x) + lim<sub>x→a</sub>c₀ = c<sub>n</sub>a<sup>n</sup> + c<sub>n-1</sub>a<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + c₁a + c₀ = p(a).

It now follows from the quotient law that if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials for which q(a) ≠ 0 ，then

lim_(x→a) p(x)/q(x) = p(a)/q(a)

Example 2.16 applies this result.

### Example 2.16

### Evaluating a Limit of a Rational Function

Evalate the limₓ→₃(2x²-3x+1)/(5x+4)

### Solution

Since is inthe domai o therationa functon f(x) = (2x² - 3x + 1)/(5x + 4) . we can calculateth li by substing 3 for $x$ into the function.Thus

lim(x→3)(2x²-3x+1)/(5x+4)=10/19

![](./images/fLREUefIS1Sxuc97QwHyb1R03AGFtRqnG.png)

2.12 　 Evaluate limₓ→⁻²(3x³ - 2x + 7)

### Additional Limit Evaluation Techniques

As we have sen, we may evaluate easily the limits of polynomials and limits of some (but not all) rational functions by direct substitution. However, as we saw in the introductory section on limits, it is certainly possible for lim_(x→a)f(x) to exist when $f(a)$ is undefined. The following observation allows us to evaluate many limits of this type:

If for all x≠a $f(x)=g(x)$ over some open interval containing a,then lim_(x→a)f(x)=lim_(x→a)g(x)

To understan thisidea bete coniderth limit limₓ→₁ (x² - 1)/(x - 1)

The function


f(x) = (x²-1)/(x-1) = (x-1)(x+1)/(x-1)

and the function $g(x)=x+1$ are identical for all values of x≠1 .The graphs of these two functions are shown in Figure 2.24.

![](./images/f0KXx3ZggrdC5H268AFIEc95pb77blBl9.png)
Figure 2.24 The graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are identical for all x≠1 .Their limits at 1 are equal.

We see that

lim_(x→1)(x²-1)/(x-1) = lim_(x→1)(x-1)(x+1)/(x-1) = lim_(x→1)(x+1) = 2

The limit has th form lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x) where 
limₓ→ₐf(x) = 0 and lim_(x→a) g(x) = 0 .(In thiscase, we say that $f(x)/g(x)$ has the indeterminate form O/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general outline for evaluating limits of this type.

 Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating a Limit When. $f(x)/g(x)$ has the Indeterminate Form 0/0

1. First, we need to make sure that our function has the appropriate form and cannot be evaluated immediately using the limit laws. 2. We then need to find a function that is equal to $h(x)=f(x)/g(x)$ for all x≠a over some interval containing a. To do this, we may need to try one or more of the following steps: a.If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials, we should factor each function and cancel out any common factors b. If the numerator or denominator contains a difference involving a square root, we should try multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression involving the square root. C.If $f(x)/g(x)$ is a complex fraction, we begin by simplifying it. 3.Last, we apply the limit laws.

The next examples demonstrate the use of this Problem-Solving Strategy. Example 2.17 illustrates the factor-and-cancel technique; Example 2.18 shows multiplying by a conjugate. In Example 2.19, we look at simplifying a complex fraction.

### Example 2.17

### Evaluating a Limit by Factoring and Canceling

Evlate lim_(x→3)(x²-3x)/(2x²-5x-3)

### Solution

Step 1. The function f(x) = 3x— is undefined for $x=3$ . In fact, if we substitute 3 into the function we get 0/0 ,which is undefined. Factoring and canceling is a good strategy:

lim_(x→3) (x²-3x)/(2x²-5x-3) = lim_(x→3) x(x-3)/((x-3)(2x+1))

Step 2. For al x ≠ 3, (x² - 3x)/(2x² - 5x - 3) = x/(2x + 1) Therefore

lim_(x→3) x/(2x+1)

Step 3.Evaluate using the limit laws:

lim_(x→3)x/(2x+1)=3/7.

2.13 Evalate  lim_(x→-3) (x²+4x+3)/(x²-9) 

### Example 2.18

### Evaluating a Limit by Multiplying by a Conjugate

Evalate lim_(x→-1) (√(x+2)-1)/(x+1)

### Solution

Step 1. Vx +21 has the form 0/0 at -1 . Let's begin by multiplying by √(x+2)+1 ， the conjugate of √x+2-1 ，on the numerator and denominator

lim_(x→-1)(√(x+2)-1)/(x+1)=lim_(x→-1)(√(x+2)-1)/(x+1)⋅(√(x+2)+1)/(√(x+2)+1)

Step 2. We then multiply out the numerator. We don't multiply out the denominator because we are hoping that the $(x+1)$ in the denominator cancels out in the end:

= lim_(x→-1)(x+1)/((x+1)(√(x+2)+1)).

Step 3.Then we cancel

Step 4. Last, we apply the limit laws

= lim_(x→-1) 1/(√(x+2) + 1)

limₓ→₋₁ 1/(√(x+2) + 1) = 1/2

![](./images/fvVXUQnGc7o6AsO5dxMCz60rAVEtkbNNW.png)

2.14 Evaluae lim_(x→5)(√(x-1)-2)/(x-5)

### Example 2.19

Evaluating a Limit by Simplifying a Complex Fraction

Evalate lim_(x→1) ((1/(x+1)) - (1/2))/(x-1)

### Solution

Step 1. (1/(x+1)-1/2)/(x-1) has the fom Io at . we sinpify the algbraie raction by mlipyig by $2(x+1)/2(x+1)$

limₓ→₁[(1/(x+1)-1/2)/(x-1)]=limₓ→₁[(1/(x+1)-1/2)/(x-1)]⋅[2(x+1)/2(x+1)]

Step 2. Next,we multiply through the numerators. Do not multiply the denominators because we want to be able to cancel the factor $(x-1)$

= lim_(x→1) (2 - (x + 1))/(2(x - 1)(x + 1)).

Step 3.Then.we simplify the numerator

lim_(x→1) (-x+1)/(2(x-1)(x+1))

Step 4. Now we factor out -1 from the numerator

=lim<sub>x→1</sub>-(x-1)/(2(x-1)(x+1))

Step 5. Then, we cancel the common factors of $(x-1)$


=limₓ→₁-1/(2(x+1))

Step 6. Last, we evaluate using the limit laws

lim_(x→1)(-1)/(2(x+1))=-1/4

#2.15 Eralate 
lim(x→-3)[(1/(x+2)+1)/(x+3)]

Example 2.20 does not fall neatly into any of the patterns established in the previous examples. However, with a little creativity, we can still use these same techniques.

### Example 2.20

Evaluating a Limit When the Limit Laws Do Not Apply.

Evalute lim_(x→0)(1/x+5/(x(x-5)))

### Solution

Both $1/x$ and $5/x(x-5)$ fail to have a limit at zero. Since neither of the two functions has a limit at zero, we cannot apply the sum law for limits; we must use a different strategy. In this case, we find the limit by performing addition and then applying one of our previous strategies. Observe that

(1/x) + 5/(x(x-5)) = (x-5+5)/(x(x-5)) = x/(x(x-5))

Thus,

limₓ→₀((1/x) + (5/(x(x-5)))) = limₓ→₀(x/(x(x-5))) = limₓ→₀(1/(x-5)) = -1/5

2.16 Eralae lim_(x→3)((1/(x-3))-(4/(x²-2x-3))).

Let's now revisit one-sided limits. Simple modifications in the limit laws allow us to apply them to one-sided limits. For example, to apply the limit laws to a limit o the fom lim_(x→a⁻)h(x) ,we require the function $h(x)$ to be defined over an open interval of the form (b, a); for limit o the form 
lim_(x→a⁺)h(x) ,we require the function $h(x)$ to be defined over an open interval of the form (a, c). Example 2.21 illustrates this point

### Example 2.21

### Evaluating a One-Sided Limit Using the Limit Laws

Evaluate each of the following limits, if possible

a.  lim_ Vx- 3

b. lim V√x- 3

### Solution

Figure 2.25 illustrates the function f(x)=√(x-3) and aids in our understanding of these limits.

![](./images/fPvynYrOX2WP2aKCCgVK0ciRKyqiTZUEx.png)

Figure 2.25The graph shows the function f(x)=√(x-3)

a.The function f(x)=√(x-3) is defined over the interval [3, +∞ ).Since this function is not defined tc the left o 3, we cannot apply the limit laws to compute lim_(x→3⁻)√(x - 3) . In fat, since f(x)=√(x-3) is undefined to the leftof 3, lim(x→3⁻)√(x - 3) does not exist. b. Since f(x)=√(x-3) is defined to the right of 3, the limit laws do apply to lim_(x→3⁺)√(x-3) .By applying these limit laws we obtain lim_(x→3⁺)√(x-3) = 0

In Example 2.22 we look at one-sided limits of a piecewise-defined function and use these limits to draw a conclusion about a two-sided limit of the same function

### Example 2.22

### Evaluating a Two-Sided Limit Using the Limit Laws

For f(x)={4x-3, (x-3)²} i讯$x<2$ valateac o th folo ing is
a. lim_(x→2⁻)f(x)
b. lim_(x→2⁺)f(x)
c. lim_(x→2⁺)f(x)

### Solution

Figure 2.26 illustrates the function $f(x)$ and aids in our understanding of these limits.

![](./images/fdxUQrWg4FZ6YnbdYASB51UYRaz4ekci7.png)
Figure 2.26 This graph shows a function $f(x)$

a.Since $f(x)=4x-3$ for all $x$ in (-∞, 2) replace $f(x)$ in the limit with $4x-3$ and apply the limit laws:

lim_(x→2⁻)f(x)=lim_(x→2⁻)(4x-3)=5.

b.Since $f(x)=(x-3)^{2}$ for all $x$ in (2,∞) replace $f(x)$ in the limit with $(x-3)^2$ and apply the limit laws:

lim(x→2⁺)f(x) = lim(x→2⁺)(x-3)² = 1

c. Since lim_(x→2⁻)f(x)=5 and limₓ→2⁺f(x)=1 weconclude that lim_(x→2)f(x) does not exist

![](./images/fwUxuGW5pNiEMPzt9BAnRsAc7fuDTmnUg.png)

2.17
f(x) = {-x-2 if x<-1; 2 if x=-1; x³ if x>-1} and evaluate lim_(x→-1⁻)f(x).

We now tum our atention to evaluating a limit of the fom lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x) where lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)=K ，where K≠0 and lim_(x→a)g(x) = 0 . That is, $f(x)/g(x)$ has the form $K/0$ K≠0 at a.

### Example 2.23

Evaluating a Limit of the Form $K/0$ K≠0 Using the Limit Laws

Evaluate lim_(x→2⁻)(x-3)/(x²-2x)

### Solution

Step 1. After substituting in $x=2$ we see that this limit has the form -1/0 .That is, as $x$ approaches 2 from the

left, the numerator approaches -1 ; and the denominator approaches 0. Consequently, the magnitude of 3 becomes infinite. To get a better idea of what the limit is, we need to factor the denominator

lim_(x→2⁻)(x-3)/(x²-2x)=lim_(x→2⁻)(x-3)/(x(x-2)).

Step 2. Since $x-2$ is the only part of the denominator that is zero when 2 is substituted, we then separate $1/(x-2)$ from the rest of the function

lim<sub>x→2⁻</sub>(x - 3)/x * 1/(x - 2)

Step 3. lim_(x→2⁻) (x-3)/x = -1/2 and lim_(x→2⁻)1/(x-2)=-∞ . Therefore, the produet of $(x-3)/x$ and $1/(x-2)$ ha a limit of +∞

lim<sub>x→2⁻</sub>(x-3)/(x²-2x) = +∞

2.18 Evalae lim_(x→1)(x+2)/(x-1)²

## The Squeeze Theorem

The techniques we have developed thus far work very well for algebraic functions, but we are still unable to evaluate limits of very basic trigonometric functions. The next theorem, called the squeeze theorem, proves very useful for establishing basic trigonometric limits. This theorem allows us to calculate limits by “squeezing” a function, with a limit at a point a that is unknown, between two functions having a common known limit at a. Figure 2.27 illustrates this idea.

![](./images/fm7rBZsuYCchDo34uniFa54nE297shE0I.png)
Figure 2.27 The Squeeze Theorem applies when

f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x) and limₓ→ₐf(x)=limₓ→ₐh(x)

### Theorem 2.7: The Squeeze Theorem

Let $f(x)$ f(x) $f( x)$, $g( x)$ $g(x)$ g(x) ,and $h(x)$ be defined for all x≠a over an open interval containing a. If

f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x)

for all x≠a in an open interval containing a and

lim_(x→a)f(x) = L = lim_(x→a)h(x)

where $L$ is a real number, then lim g(x)= L.

## Example 2.24

Applying the Squeeze Theorem

Apply the squeeze theorem to evaluate limₓ→₀ x cos x

### Solution

Because -1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 for all x, we have -|x| ≤ x cos x ≤ |x| . Since lim<sub>x→0</sub>(-|x|) = 0 = lim<sub>x→0</sub>|x| ，from the squeeze theorem, we obtain lim_ xcos.x = O. The graphs of $f(x)=-$ [xl, g(x)=xcosx ，and $h(x)=|x|$ are shown inFigure 2.28

![](./images/fgXcSGewmLGEmVS0nSUPE2CBzU2NgZsCW.png)
Figure 2.28 The graphs of $f(x)$ f(x) $f( x)$, $g( x)$ g（x） $g(x)$ ，and $h(x)$ are shown

around the point $x=0$

![](./images/f0P9bsNIkHMl5Lfnp2rVpRuyUbvHGDW0i.png)

2.19Use the squeeze theorem t ealuate lim<sub>x→0</sub>x²sin(1/x)

We now use the squeeze theorem to tackle several very important limits. Although this discussion is somewhat lengthy, these limits prove invaluable for the development of the material in both the next section and the next chapter. The first of these limits is limθ→0sinθ . Consider the unit circe shown in Figure 2.29. In the figure, we seethat sinθ is the y-coordinate

on the unit circle and it corresponds to the line segment shown in blue. The radian measure of angle $b$ is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see that for O < θ < , 0<sinθ<θ

![](./images/fsaDnX6e8wGL0G8RTbgaM0gcFAntkV0OC.png)
Figure 2.29 The sine function is shown as a line on the unit

circle.

Because lim 0 = 0 and 
lim<sub>θ→0⁺</sub>θ = 0 .by using the queeze theorem we conclude that

lim_(θ→0⁺)sinθ=0.

To see that lim θ→0⁻sinθ=0 as well, observe that for -π/2<θ<0, 0 < -θ < π/2 and hence, 0 < sin(-θ) < -θ Consequently, 0<-sinθ<-θ .It follows that 0>sinθ>θ An application of the squeeze theorem produces the desired limit. Thus, since lim θ→0⁺ sinθ=0 and lim θ→0⁻sinθ=0


limθ→₀ sin θ = 0.

Next, using the identity cos θ = √(1-sin²θ) for 
-π/2 < θ < π/2, we see that

lim_(θ→0)cosθ=lim_(θ→0)√(1-sin²θ)=1

We now take a look at alimit tha plays an important role in Iaer chaptersnamely. lim_(θ→0) sinθ/θ To evaluate this limit we use the unit circle in Figure 2.30. Notice that this figure adds one additional triangle to Figure 2.30. We see that the length of the side opposite angle θ in this new triangle is tan θ Thus, we see that for O<θ< sinθ < θ < tanθ

![](./images/f4DPdTdsqi1lVTEA0hxxDsc8nvA6kMSE2.png)
Figure 2.30The sine and tangent functions are shown as lines

on the unit circle.

By dividing by sinθ in all parts of the inequality,we obtain

1 < θ/sinθ < 1/cosθ

Equivalently, we have

1>sinθ/θ>cosθ.

Since lim θ→0⁺1=1=lim θ→0⁺cosθ we cncludethat lim(θ→0⁺)sinθ/θ = 1 B aplying a manipulatio similarto tha usedl in demonstrating that lim θ→0⁻sinθ=0 we can show that lim_(θ→0⁻)sinθ/θ=1 . Thus,


lim(θ→0)sinθ/θ=1

In Example 2.25 we us this limit establish lim θ→0 (1 - cos θ)/θ = 0 This lmitaso pros eulinlter haps.

### Example 2.25

Evaluating an Important Trigonometric Limit

Evluate lim(θ→0)(1-cosθ)/θ

### Solution

In the first step, we multiply by the conjugate so that we can use a trigonometric identity to convert the cosine in the numerator to a sine

limθ→0(1−cosθ)/θ = 0

lim(θ→0)(1-cosθ)/θ=0

Therefore,

(2.19)

# Student PROJECT

## Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle

Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate some of the methods of calculus. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (ca. 287-212; BCE) was particularly inventive, using polygons inscribed within circles to approximate the area of the circle as the number of sides of the polygon increased. He never came up with the idea of a limit, but we can use this idea to see what his geometric constructions could have predicted about the limit.

We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the regulal polygon as being made up of $n$ triangles. By taking the limit as the vertex angle of these triangles goes to zero, you can obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:

1.Express the height h and the base $b$ of the isosceles triangle in Figure 2.31 in terms of θ and $r$

2. Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of θ and $r$ (Substitute (1/2)sinθ for sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) in your expression.

3.If an $n$ -sided regular polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius $r$ find a relationship between θ and n.Solve this for TI .Keep in mind there are 2π radians in a circle. (Use radians, not degrees.)

4.Find an expression for the area of the $n$ sided polygon in terms of $r$ and 0

5.To find a formula for the area of the circle, find the limit of the expression in step 4 as θ goes to zero. (Hint: limθ→₀(sinθ)/θ=1 .

# 2.4 | Continuity

# Learning Objectives

2.4.1Explain the three conditions for continuity at a point. 2.4.2 Describe three kinds of discontinuities 2.4.3 Define continuity on an interval. 2.4.4 State the theorem for limits of composite functions.. 2.4.5 Provide an example of the intermediate value theorem

Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said to have a discontinuity at a point where a break occurs.

We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have continuity at a point. Intuitively. a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.

## Continuity at a Point

Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let's consider various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create a list of conditions that prevent such failures.

Our first function of interest is shown in Figure 2.32. We see that the graph of $f(x)$ has a hole at $a$ .In fact, $f(a)$ is undefined. At the very least, for $f(x)$ to be continuous at $a$ we need the following condition

![](./images/fpahguL21pTbDMs2LNAWwdSEPHwu7tmiz.png)

Figure 2.32 The function $f(x)$ is not continuous at 

because $f(a)$ is undefined.

However, as we see in Figure 2.33, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although $f(a)$ is defined, the function has a gap at a. In this example, the gap exists because lim_f(x) does not exist. We must add another condition for continuity at a—namely,

 lim_(x→a) f(x) exists. 

![](./images/fEmoZVmkX0PxCIE4GLQbP0DQtCYKPxmGN.png)
Figure 2.33The function $f(x)$ is not continuous at a

because lim_(x→a)f(x) does not exist.

However, as we see in Figure 2.34, these two conditions by themselves do not guarantee continuity at a point. The function in this figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at a. We must add a third condition to our list:

![](./images/fZky3HOV14aoRHe3q3tAnN88VIsKpki5C.png)
Figure 2.34 The function $f(x)$ is not continuous at a

because lim_(x→a)f(x)≠f(a)

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.

### Definition

A function $f(x)$ is continuous at a point a if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

i. $f(a)$ is defined il lim_(x→a)f(x) exists li。lim_(x→a)f(x)=f(a)

Afunction isdiscontinuous at apointaif it fails tobe continuous at a.

The following procedure can be used to analvze the continuitv of a function at a point using this definition

## Problem-Solving Strategy: Determining Continuity at a Point

1. Check to see if $f(a)$ isdefined. If $f(a)$ is undefined, we need go no further. The function is not continuous at $a$ .If $f(a)$ is defined, continue to step 2. 2. Compute lim_(x→a)f(x) . In some cases, we may need to do this by first computing lim_(x→a⁻)f(x) and lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) If lim_(x→a)f(x) does not exist (that is, it is not a real number), then the function is not continuous at $a$ and the problem is solved. If lim_(x→a)f(x) exists, then continue to step 3. 3. Compare $f(a)$ and lim_(x→a)f(x) . If lim_(x→a)f(x)≠f(a) , then the function is not continuous at $a$ . If lim_(x→a)f(x)=f(a) , then the function is continuous at $a$

The next three examples demonstrate how to apply this definition to determine whether a function is continuous at a given point. These examples illustrate situations in which each of the conditions for continuity in the definition succeed or fail.

# Example 2.26

Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 1

Using the definition, determine whether the function $f(x)=(x^{2}-4)/(x-2)$ is continuous at $x=2$ . Justify the conclusion.

# Solution

Let's begin by trying to calculate $f(2)$ .We can see that $f(2)=0/0$ which is undefined. Therefore, f(x)=(x²-4)/(x-2) is discontinuous at 2 because $f(2)$ is undefined. The graph of $f(x)$ is shown in Figure 2.35

![](./images/f1sb9BV7iMgGzuLb7esR6z5q2mZctOSMV.png)
Figure 2.35 The function $f(x)$ is discontinuous at 2 because

$f(2)$ is undefined.

### Example 2.27

### Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 2

Usig th i he .cio f(x)={-x²+4 if x≤3; 4x-8 if x>3} x ≤ 3 $x>3$ is coninous at $x=3$ Jusify the conclusion

### Solution

Let's begin by trying to calculate $f(3)$

$$f(3)=-(3^2)+4=-5.$$

Thus, $f(3)$ is defined. Next, we calculate limₓ→₃f(x) .To do this, we must compute lim(x→3⁻)f(x) and lim(x→3⁺)f(x):

lim<sub>x→3⁻</sub>f(x) = -(3²) + 4 = -5

and

limₓ→₃⁺f(x)=4(3)−8=4

Therefore, limₓ→₃f(x) does not exist. Thus, $f(x)$ is not continuous at 3. The graph of $f(x)$ is shown in Figure 2.36.

![](./images/ftgGVCYKOXfkfrFViMZ8Po5yaq2eoa4Sr.png)
Figure 2.36 The function $f(x)$ is not continuous at 3

because limₓ→₃f(x) does not exist.

### Example 2.28

### Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 3

Using the deiniton emine hethe h uncion f(x)={sinx/x; 1} i证x ≠ 0 is continous at $x=0$

### Solution

First, observe that

$$f(0)=1.$$

Next,

lim_(x→0)f(x)=lim_(x→0)sinx/x=1.

Last, compare $f(0)$ and lim_(x→1)f(x) .We see that

f(0)=1=lim_(x→0)f(x)

Since all three of the conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$

![](./images/f5kNBTGGZBHSCgxXFbWgGGZBMlCUgkkZs.png)

2-2 Usig hedefntion eterie heterth fnctore f(x) = {2x+1 if x<1; 2 if x=1; -x+4 if x>1} X1 $x<1$ is ontinou at $x=1$ If the function is not continuous at 1, indicate the condition for continuity at a point that fails to hold.

By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits, we can state the following theorem.

### Theorem 2.8: Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions.

Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

### Proof

Previously, we showed that if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials, lim_(x→a)p(x)=p(a) for every polynomial $p(x)$ and lim_(x→a) p(x)/q(x) = p(a)/q(a) as long as q(a) ≠ 0 . Therefore, polymomials and raioal functions ae continuous o their domains

口We now apply Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions to determine the points at which a given rational function is continuous.

### Example 2.29

### Continuity of a Rational Function

For what values of $X$ is f(x) = (x + 1)/(x - 5) continuous?

### Solution

The rational function f(x) = (x+1)/(x-5) is continuous for every value of $X$ except $x=5$

![](./images/fo46WS8u8iE4seNzDMGxrEZyKrzQ3VEYX.png)

2.22For what values of $X$ is $f(x)=3x^{4}-4x^{2}$ continuous

## Types of Discontinuities

As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27,discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities.Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.

![](./images/fMvkpL8za1gtPoYGcTZvTddecLGdlgGZI.png)

Figure 2.37 Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite

These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:

### Definition

If $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $a$ ,then

1. $f$ has a removable discontinuity at a if lim_(x→a)f(x) exists. (Note: When we state that lim_(x→a)f(x) exists, we mean that limₓ→ₐf(x) = L ，where $L$ is a real number) 2. $f$ has a jump discontinuty a aif lim_(x→a⁻)f(x) and lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) both exist, but lim_(x→a⁻)f(x) ≠ lim_(x→a⁺)f(x) (Note: When we state that lim_(x→a⁻)f(x) and lim<sub>x→a⁺</sub>f(x) both exist, we mean that both are ral-valued and that neither take on the values ±∞ 3. $f$ has an infinite discontinuityat $a$ if lim(x→a⁻)f(x)=±∞ or lim_(x→a⁺)f(x)=±∞

## Example 2.30

### Classifying a Discontinuity

In Example 2.26, we showed that f(x)=(x²-4)/(x-2) is discontinuous at $x=2$ .Classify this discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

### Solution

To classfy the discontinuity at 2 we must evaluate lim<sub>x→2</sub>f(x)

lim_(x→2)f(x)=lim_(x→2)(x²−4)/(x−2)=lim_(x→2)(x−2)(x+2)/(x−2)=lim_(x→2)(x+2)=4

Since $f$ is discontinuous at 2 and lim_f(x) exists, $f$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=2$

### Example 2.31

### Classifying a Discontinuity.

In Example 2.2, we shoved that f(x) = {-x²+4 if x≤3; 4x-8 if x>3} x≤3 x ≤ 3 is discontinuous at $x=3$ . Clasify this discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

### Solution

Earlier, we showed that $f$ is discontinuous at 3 because limₓ→₃f(x) does not exist. However, since lim_(x→3⁻)f(x) = -5 and lim_(x→3⁺)f(x) = 4 both exist, weconcle that theftionha jpdisntiity t

### Example 2.32

### Classifying a Discontinuity

Determine whether f(x) = (x+2)/(x+1) is continuous at -1 .If the function is discontinuous at -1 , classify the discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

### Solution

The function value $f(-1)$ is undefined. Therefore, the function is not continuous at -1 . To determine the type of

disontiuity west e hlitat -1 We se that lim(x→-1) -(x+2)/(x+1) = -∞
lim_(x→-1⁺)(x+2)/(x+1)=+∞
Therefore, the function has an infinite discontinuity at -1

![](./images/f8msaO4X9tDZIWPWodepQ9hbKUAR33Cvg.png)

2.23 For f(x) = {x² if x≠1, 3 if x=1}, x≠1 x≠1 decide whether $f$ is continuous a 1. f $f$ is not contiuou t I clasiy he discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite

# Continuity over an Interval

Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point,we extend that idea to continuity over an interval. As we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea that a function is continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in the interval without lifting the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and continuous from the left at a point.

### Continuity from the Right and from the Left

A function $f(x)$ is said to be continuous rom the right at a if lim_(x→a⁺)f(x)=f(a)

A function $f(x)$ issid to e continous from thletat f lim_(x→a⁻)f(x)=f(a)

A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function $f(x)$ is continuous over a closed interval of the form $[a,b]$ $b|$ b if it is continuous at every point in $(a,b)$ and is continuous from the right at a and is continuous from the left at $b$ . Analogously, a function $f(x)$ is continuous over an interval of the form (a, $b]$ if it is continuous over $(a,b)$ and is continuous from the left at $b$ . Continuity over other types of intervals are defined in a similar fashion

Requiring that lim_(x→a⁺)f(x) = f(a) and lim<sub>x→b⁻</sub>f(x)=f(b) ensure that we can racethe graph of the fntion from the point (a, $f(a)]$ to the point $(b$ ， $f(b))$ without lifting the pencil. If, for example, limₓ→ₐ⁺f(x)≠f(a) we would need to lift our pencil to jump from $f(a)$ to the graph of the rest of the function over (a, b]

## Example 2.33

### Continuity on an Interval

State the interval(s ver which the function f(x)=(x-1)/(x²+2x) is continuous

### Solution

Since f(x)=(x-1)/(x²+2x) isarationalfntion it is conius at every point its dmainhedn $f(x)$ is the set (−∞,−2)∪(−2,0)∪(0,+∞) .Thus, $f(x)$ is continuous over each of the interval

(∞o, 2), (2, 0), and (0,+∞)

# Example 2.34

### Continuity over an Interval

State the interval(s) over which the function f(x) = √(4 - x²) is continuous.

## Solution

From the limit laws, we know that lim_(x→a)√(4-x²) = √(4-a²) for all value of α in (-2, 2). We also know that im+14 -x2²=0 exis and lim<sub>x→2⁻</sub>√(4 - x²) = 0 exis. Therefore, $f(x)$ is contiuous over the interval [2, 2].

![](./images/fSiYIoLb2ryEKTRngG84SWmKKXAPPg1tc.png)

2.24State the interval(s) over which the function f(x) = √(x + 3) is continuous

The Composite Function Theorem allows us to expand our ability to compute limits.In particular,this theorem ultimately allows us to demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.

## Theorem 2.9: Composite Function Theorem

If $f(x)$ is continuous at $L$ and lim_(x→a)g(x)=L ，then

lim_(x→a)f(g(x)) = f(lim_(x→a)g(x)) = f(L).

Before we move on to Example 2.35, recal that earlier, in the section on limit laws, we showed lim_(x→0)cos x=1=cos(0) Consequently, we know that f(x)=cos x is continuous at 0. In Example 2.35 we see how to combine this result with the composite function theorem.

## Example 2.35

Limit of a Composite Cosine Function

Evaluate lim_(x→π/2)cos(x-π/2).

## Solution

The given function is a composite of cos.x and x-π/2 Since lim_(x→π/2)(x-π/2)=0 and cos $X$ is continuous at 0, we may apply the composite function theorem. Thus,

lim(x→π/2)cos(x - π/2) = cos(lim(x→π/2)(x - π/2)) = cos(0) = 1

![](./images/fLbw7apkvhR34Z11Mur7cPWxTq2eiL7tG.png)

2.25 Evaluate lim_(x→π)sin(x-π)

The proof of the next theorem uses the composite function theorem as well as the continuity of f(x)=sin x and g(x) = cos x at the point O to show that trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains

# Theorem 2.10: Continuity of Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains

# Proof

We begin by demonstrating that cos $x$ is continuous at every real number. To do this, we must show that lim(x→a)cos x = cos a for all values of $a$

lim_(x→a)cos x = lim_(x→a)cos((x-a)+a) = lim_(x→a)(cos(x-a)cosa - sin(x-a)sina) = cos(lim_(x→a)(x-a))cosa - sin(lim_(x→a)(x-a))sina = cos(0)cosa - sin(0)sina = cosa

The proof that sin x is continuous at every real number is analogous. Because the remaining trigonometric functions may be expressed in terms of sin x and cos.x, their continuity follows from the quotient limit law.

口As you can see, the composite function theorem is invaluable in demonstrating the continuity of trigonometric functions. As we continue our study of calculus, we revisit this theorem many times.

# The Intermediate Value Theorem.

Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form [a, b], where α and b are real numbers, exhibit many useful properties. Throughout our study of calculus, we will encounter many powerful theorems concerming such functions. The first of these theorems is the Intermediate Value Theorem..

# Theorem 2.11: The Intermediate Value Theorem

Let f be continuous over a closed, bounded interval $[a,b].$ If $Z$ is any real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ ，then there is a number $c$ in $[a,b]$ satisfying $f(c)=z$ inFigure 2.38

![](./images/fWMbGeT0IYyMXKEG5f7sWfeoEgtGiEIi4.png)
Figure2.38There is a number c∈[a,b] that satisfies

$$f(c)=z.$$

# Example 2.36

Application of the Intermediate Value Theorem

Show that f(x)=x-cosx has at least one zero.

### Solution

Since f(x)=x-cosx is continuous over (-∞, +∞) ,it is continuous over any closed interval of the form [a, b]. If you can find an interval $[a,b]$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, you can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude there must be a real number $C$ in $(a,b)$ $b$ b that satisfies $f(c)=0$ .Note that

f(0)=0-cos(0)=-1<0

and

f(π/2) = π/2 - cos(π/2) = π/2 > 0

Using the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can see that there must be a real number $C$ in [0, π/2 that satisfies $f(c)=0$ . Therefore, f(x)=x-cosx has at least one zero

## Example 2.37

When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

If $f(x)$ is continuous over [0, 2], $f(0)>0$ and $f(2)>0$ ,can we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that $f(x)$ has no zeros in the interval [0, 2]? Explain.

### Solution

No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between $f(0)$ and $f(2)$ ; it doesn't allow us to conclude that we can't find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the function $f(x)=(x-1)^{2}$ It satisfies f(0) = 1 > 0 $f(0)=1>0$ f(2) =1>0 $f(2)=1>0$ $f( 0) = 1> 0$, $f( 2) = 1> 0$, and $f( 1) = 0.$

### Example 2.38

When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?.

For $f(x)=1/x$ $f(-1)=-1<0$ and $f(1)=1>0$ .Can we conclude that $f(x)$ has a zero in the interval [1, 1]?

### Solution

No. The function is not continuous over [-1] , 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

2.26 Show that $f(x)=x^{3}-x^{2}-3x+1$ has a zero over the interval [0, 1]

# 2.5| ThePreciseDefinition of a Limit

# Learning Objectives

2.5.1 Describe the epsilon-delta definition of a limit

2.5.2 Apply the epsilon-delta definition to find the limit of a function. 2.5.3 Describe the epsilon-delta definitions of one-sided limits and infinite limits. 2.5.4Use the epsilon-delta definition to prove thelimit laws.

By now you have progressed from the very informal definition of a limit in the introduction of this chapter to the intuitive understanding of a limit. At this point, you should have a very strong intuitive sense of what the limit of a function means and how you can find it. In this section, we convert this intuitive idea of a limit into a formal definition using precise mathematical language. The formal definition of a limit is quite possibly one of the most challenging definitions you will encounter early in your study of calculus; however, it is well worth any effort you make to reconcile it with your intuitive notion of a limit. Understanding this definition is the key that opens the door to a better understanding of calculus

# Quantifying Closeness

Before stating the formal definition of a limit, we must introduce a few preliminary ideas. Recall that the distance between two points a and $b$ on a number line is given by $|a-b|$

·The statement |f(x)-L| < ε may be interpreted as: The distance between $f(x)$ and $L$ is less than E.

·The statement 0<|x-a|<δ may be interpreted as: x≠a and the distance between x and a is less than 5

It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:

·The statement |f(x)-L| < ε is equivalent to the statement L-ε < f(x) < L+ε

·The statement 0<|x-a|<δ is equivalent to the statement a-δ<x<a+δ and x≠a

With these clarifications,we can state the formal epsilon-delta definition of thelimit

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be defined for all x≠a over an open interval containing a. Let $L$ be a real number. Then

limₓ→ₐf(x) = L

if, for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 ，such that if 0<|x-a|<δ ，then |f(x)-L| < ε

This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we break it down phrase by phrase. The statement itself involves something called a universal quantifier (for every ε > 0 ),an existential quantifier (there exists a δ > 0 )，and, last,a conditional statement (if 0<|x-a|<δ ，then |f(x)-L|<ε Let's take a look at Table 2.9, which breaks down the definition and translates each part.


1.9999|d.|2.0001|h.
Table 2.9 Translation of the Epsilon-Delta Definition of the Limit.

We can get a better handle on this definition by looking at the definition geometrically.Figure 2.39 shows possible values of δ for various choices of ε > 0 for a given function $f(x)$ a number a, and a limit $L$ at a. Notice that as we choose smaller values of $E$ (the distance between the function and the limit), we can always find a δ small enough so that if we have chosen an $x$ value within δ of $a$ , then the value of $f(x)$ is within ε of the limit $L$

![](./images/fqSSy2oYd3fgBf68VwmESqwFQcH4wYRKg.png)
Figure 2.39 These graphs show possible values of δ , given successively smaller choices of E.

:The epsilon-delta definition of limit (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_epsilondelt)

Example 2.39 shows how you can use this definition to prove a statement about the limit of a specific function at a specified value.

# Example 2.39

Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function

Prove that limₓ→₁ (2x+1)=3

 Solution

Let ε > 0

The first part of the definition begins “For every ε > 0 This means we must prove that whatever follows is true no matter what positive value of $E$ is chosen. By stating “Let ε > 0 we signal our intent to do so.

Choose δ=ε/2

The definition continues with “there exists a δ > 0 ." The phrase “there exists” in a mathematical statement is always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and find δ So, where exactly did δ=ε/2 come from? There are two basic approaches to tracking down δ One method is purely algebraic and the other is geometric.

We begin by tackling the problem from an algebraic point of view. Since ultimately we want |(2x+1)-3| < ε we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x+1)-3| < ε is equivalent to |2x-2|<ε which in turn is equivalent to 2|x-1|<ε .Last, this is equivalent to |x-1| < ε/2 .Thus, it would seem that δ=ε/2 is appropriate.

We may also find δ through geometric methods. Figure 2.40 demonstrates how this is done.

![](./images/f4vDkT26qiGa4rlqbTGYuyAovhSD0niHg.png)
Figure 2.40 This graph shows how we find δ geometrically

Assume 0 < |x - 1| < δ .When δ has been chosen, our goal is to show that if 0 < |x - 1| < δ ，then |(2x+1)-3| < ε To prove any statement of the form “If this, then that,” we begin by assuming “this” and trying to get “that.”

Thus,
|(2x+1)-3|=|2x-2|=|2(x-1)|=|2||x-1|=2|x-1|<2⋅δ=2⋅ε/2=ε

## Analysis

In this part of the proof, we started with $|(2x+1)-3|$ and used our assumption 0 < |x - 1| < δ in a key part of the chain of inequalities to get $|(2x+1)-3|$ to be less than $E$ We could just as easily have manipulated the assumed inequality 0 < |x - 1| < δ to arrive at |(2x+1)-3| < ε as follows

0<|x-1|<δ ⇒|x-1|<δ ⇒-δ<x-1<δ ⇒-ε/2<x-1<ε/2 ⇒-ε<2x-2<ε ⇒-ε<2x-2<ε ⇒|2x-2|<ε ⇒|(2x+1)-3|<ε

Therefore, lim(x→1)(2x+1)=3 (Having completed the proof, we state what we have accomplished.)

After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof

Let ε > 0

Choose δ=ε/2

Assume 0 < |x - 1| < δ

Thus,
|(2x + 1) - 3| = |2x - 2| = |2(x - 1)| = 2|x - 1| < 2δ = 2(ε/2) = ε

Therefore, limₓ→₁ (2x+1)=3

The following Problem-Solving Strategy summarizes the type of proof we worked out in Example 2.39

 Problem-Solving Strategy: Proving That limₓ→ₐf(x) = L for a Specific Function $f(x)$

1.Let's begin the proof with the following statement:Let ε > 0 2. Next, we need to obtain a value for δ .After we have obtained this value, we make the following statement, filling in the blank with our choice of δ Choose 6= δ= δ= 3.The next statement in the proof should be (at this point, we fill in our given value for a): Assume 0<|x-a|<δ 4. Next, based on this assumption, we need to show that |f(x)-L| < ε where $f(x)$ and $L$ are our function $f(x)$ and our limit $L$ .At some point, we need to use 0<|x-a|<δ 5. We conclude our proof with the statement: Therefore, limₓ→ₐf(x) = L

## Example 2.40

### Proving a Statement about a Limit

Complete the proo that lim_(x→-1)(4x+1)=-3 by filing in the blanks.

Let Choose δ= Assume 0 < |x - _| < δ Thus, I

### Solution

We begin by filling in the blanks where the choices are specified by the definition. Thus, we have

Let ε > 0 Choose δ= Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| < δ or equivalently, 0<|x+1|<δ Thus.
|(4x+1)-(-3)|=|4x+4|=|4||x+1|<4δ≤ε
Focusing on the final line of the proof, we se that we should choose δ = Ɛ/4 We now complete the final write-up of the proof Let ε > 0 Choose δ=ε/4. Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| < δ (or equivalently, 
0 < |x + 1| < δ  Thus, |4x+1|-|-3|=|4x+4|=4|x+1|<4δ=4(ε/4)=ε.

2.27Complete the proof that lim<sub>x→2</sub>(3x-2)=4 by filling in the blanks

![](./images/fGlxBgoCLQbvh6sDwmZA7nqM1ASr2fRWO.png)

Let Choose = Assume 0 < |x-1| Thus, Therefore, limₓ→₂(3x-2)=4

In Example 2.39 and Example 2.40,the proofs were fairly straightforward, since the functions with which we were working were linear. In Example 2.41, we see how to modify the proof to accommodate a nonlinear function.

Example 2.41

### Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Geometric Approach)

Prove that lim_(x→2)x²=4

### Solution

1.Let ε > 0 .The first part of the definition begins “For every ℰ>0 ”so we must prove that whatever follows is true no matter what positive value of $E$ is chosen. By stating "Let $E>0$ we signal our intent to do so

2.Without loss of generality, assume ε ≤ 4 .Two questions present themselves: Why do we want ε ≤ 4 and why is it okay to make this assumption? In answer to the first question: Later on, in the process of solving for δ ,，we will discover that δ involves the quantity √(4-ε) . Consequently, we need E≤4 .In answer to the second question: If we can find δ > 0 that “works” for ε ≤ 4 ,then it will “"work" for any ε>4 as well. Keep in mind that, although it is always okay to put an upper bound on $E$ it isnever oka to put a lower bound (other than zero) on E.

3.Choose =min24-e,4 + ε-2}.Figure 2.41 shows how we made this choice of δ

![](./images/fb9SaGAa4rfGgWhUxe8gPgQMdBlWUIEfw.png)

4.We must show: If 0<|x-2|<δ then |x²−4| < ε ，so we must begin by assuming

0 < |x - 2| < δ

We don't really need $0<|x-2|$ (in other words, 
x≠2 for this proof. Since 0<|x-2|<δ⇒|x-2|<δ, it is okay to drop $0<|x-2$

|x-2|<δ.

Hence,

-δ<x-2<δ.

Recallthat δ = min{2 - √(4 - ε), √(4 + ε) - 2} Thus, δ ≤ 2 - √(4 - ε) and co δ ≤ 2 - √(4-ε) δ ≤ 2 - √(4-ε) nsequently -(2-√(4-ε)) ≤ -δ We also use δ ≤ √(4+ε) - 2 here. We might ask at this point: Why did we substitute 2-√(4-ε) for δ on the left-hand side of the inequality and √(4 + ε) - 2 on the right-hand side of the inequality? If we look at Figure 2.41, we see that 2-√(4-ε) corresponds to the distance on

the left of 2 on the X -axis and 
⁴√4+ε-2 corresponds to the distance on the right. Thus

-(2 - √(4-ε)) ≤ -δ < x - 2 < δ ≤ √(4+ε) - 2

We simplify the expression on the left

-2+√(4-ε)<x-2<√(4+ε)-2

Then, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:

√(4-ε) < x < √(4+ε)

We square all parts of the inequality. It is okay to do so, since all parts of the inequality are positive:

4-ε<x²<4+ε

We subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality

-ε < x² - 4 < ε

Last,

|x² - 4| < ε.

5.Therefore,

limₓ→₂ x² = 4

2.28 Find 8 corresponding to ε > 0 for a proof that lim_(x→9) √x = 3

The geometric approach to proving that the limit of a function takes on a specific value works quite well for some functions. Also, the insight into the formal definition of the limit that this method provides is invaluable. However, we may also approach limit proofs from a purely algebraic point of view. In many cases, an algebraic approach may not only provide us with additional insight into the definition, it may prove to be simpler as well. Furthermore, an algebraic approach is the primary tool used in proofs of statements about limits. For Example 2.42, we take on a purely algebraic approach

## Example 2.42

Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Algebraic Approach

Prove that lim<sub>x→-1</sub>(x²-2x+3)=6

### Solution

Let's use our outline from the Problem-Solving Strategy

1.Let ε > 0

2. Choose δ = min{1, ε/5} 4.This choice of δ may appear odd at first glance, but it was obtained by

taking a look at our ultimate desired inequality: |(x²-2x+3)-6|<ε . This inequality is equivalent to |x+1|⋅|x-3| < ε .At this point, the temptation simply to choose δ=ε/(x-3) is very strong. Unfortunately, our choice of δ must depend on $E$ only and no other variable. If we can replace $|x-3$ by a numerical value, our problem can be resolved. This is the place where assuming δ≤1 comes into play The choice of δ≤1 here is arbitrary. We could have just as easily used any other positive number. In some proofs, greater care in this choice may be necessary. Now, since δ≤1 and |x+1|<δ≤1 ，we are able to show that $|x-3|<5$ .Consequently, |x+1|·|x-3|<|x+1|·5 .At this point we realize that we also need δ ≤ ε/5 .Thus, we choose δ = min{ 1, ε/5

3. Assume 
0 < |x + 1| < δ  .Thus,


30) |x+1| < 1 and |x+1| < ε/5.

Since $|x+1|<1$ ，we may conclude that $-1<x+1<1$ .Thus, by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality, we obtain $-5<x-3<-1$ .Consequently, $|x-3|<5$ .This gives us

|(x²-2x+3)-6|=|x+1|⋅|x-3|<ε

Therefore,

lim(x→-1)(x²-2x+3)=6.

2.29 Comple the proof that lim_(x→1)x²=1

![](./images/fsegQi5BA19tC9YW7PxSZ7LR4KstgV31l.png)

Let ε > 0 ；choose δ = min{ 1, ε/3 ; assume 0 < |x - 1| < δ

Since $|x-1|<1$ ，wemay conclude that $-1<x-1<1$ .Thus, $1<x+1<3$ .Hence, $|x+1|<3$

You will find that, in general, the more complex a function, the more likely it is that the algebraic approach is the easiest to apply. The algebraic approach is also more useful in proving statements about limits

## Proving Limit Laws

We now demonstrate how to use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to construct a rigorous proof of one of the limit laws. The triangle inequality is used at a key point of the proof, so we first review this key property of absolute value.

### Definition

The triangle inequality states that if $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers,then |a+b|≤|a|+|b|

### Proof

We prove the folowing limit law: If limₓ→ₐf(x) = L and lim_(x→a)g(x)=M ，then lim_(x→a)(f(x)+g(x)) = L+M

Let ε > 0

Choose δ₁ > 0 so that if 0<|x-a|<δ₁ ，then |f(x) - L| < ε/2

Choose δ₂>0 so that if 
0<|x-a|<δ₂ ，then |g(x)-M|<ε/2

Choose δ = min{δ₁, δ₂

Assume 0<|x-a|<δ

Thus,

0<|x-a|<δ₁ and 
0<|x-a|<δ₂

Hence,

||f(x) + g(x) - (L + M)|| = |(f(x) - L) + (g(x) - M)| ≤ |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < ε/2 + ε/2 = ε

口

We now explore what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit lim_(x→a)f(x) does not exist if there is no real number $L$ for which lim_f(x) = L. Thus, for all real numbers $L$ ,lim_f(x) ≠ L. To understand what this means, we look at each part of the definition of limₓ→ₐf(x) = L together with its opposite. A translation of the definition is given in Table 2.10.


θ|(π/θ) sin|θ|(π/θ) sin

Table 2.10 Translation of the Definition of limₓ→ₐf(x) = L and its Opposite

Finally, we may state what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit lim_(x→a)f(x) does not exist if for every real number $L$ there exists a real number ε > 0 So that for all δ > 0 there is an $x$ satisfying 0<|x-a|<δ so that |f(x)-L| ≥ ε Let's apply this in Example 2.43 to show that a limit does not exist.

## Example 2.43

Showing That a Limit Does Not Exist

Show that lim_(x→0)|x|/x does not exist. The graph of $f(x)=|x|/x$ is shown here

![](./images/fUHe0Cf0XyU2ex8ypALPrQxcqShI8zZ9r.png)

### Solution

Suppose that $L$ is a candidate for a limit. Choose ε=1/2

Let δ > 0 Either L ≥ 0 or $L<0$ .If L ≥ 0 ，then let x = -δ/2 .Thus,

|x-0| = |-δ/2 - 0| = δ/2 < δ

and

||-δ/2|/(-δ/2)-L|=|-1-L|=L+1≥1>1/2=ε

On the other hand, if $L<0$ ，then let x = δ/2 .Thus,

|x-0|=|δ/2-0|=δ/2<δ

and

|(|δ/2|)/(δ/2)-L|=|1-L|=|L|+1≥1>1/2=ε.

Thus, fo any value of $L$ lim_(x→0)|x|/x≠L

## One-Sided and Infinite Limits

Just as we first gained an intuitive understanding of limits and then moved on to a more rigorous definition of a limit we now revisit one-sided limits. To do this, we modify the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to give formal epsilon-delta definitions for limits from the right and left at a point. These definitions only require slight modifications from the definition of the limit. In the definition of the limit from the right, the inequality 0 < x - a < δ replaces 0<|x-a|<δ which ensures that we only consider values of $x$ that are greater than (to the right of) a. Similarly, in the definition of the limit from the left, the inequality. 
12) -δ < x - a < 0 replaces 0<|x-a|<δ which ensures that we only consider values of $X$ that are less than (to the left of) $a$

### Definition

Limit from theRight:Let $f(x)$ be defined over an open interval of the form $(a,b)$ where $a<b$ .Then,

lim_(x→a⁺)f(x)=L

if for every ε > 0 ，there exists a δ > 0 such that if 0 < x - a < δ then |f(x)-L| < ε

Limit from the Left: Let $f(x)$ be defined over an open interval of the form $(b,c)$ where $b<c$ .Then

lim_(x→a⁻) f(x) = L

if for every ε > 0 ，there exists a δ > 0 such that if 
12) -δ < x - a < 0 then |f(x)-L| < ε

### Example 2.44

Proving a Statement about a Limit From the Right

Prove that limₓ→₄⁺√(x-4)=0

### Solution

Let ε > 0

Choose δ = ε² .Since we ultimately want |\sqrt{x-4}-0|<ε ,we manipulate this inequality to get √(x-4)<ε or, equivalently, 0 < x - 4 < ε² ，making δ = ε² a clear choice. We may also determine δ geometrically, as shown inFigure 2.42

![](./images/fBE41vBUIrHH9MfkXK5Zwui08bl9YzpTG.png)
Figure 2.42 This graph shows how we find 8 for the proof in

Example 2.44.

Assume 0 < x - 4 < δ .Thus, 0 < x - 4 < ε² Hence, 0 < √(x-4) < ε . Finally, |\sqrt{x-4}-0|<ε Therefore, lim_(x→4⁺)√x-4=0

2.30 Find δ corresponding to for a proof that limₓ→1⁻√(1-x) = 0

We conclude the process of converting our intuitive ideas of various types of limits to rigorous formal definitions by

pursuing a formal definition of infinite limits. To have lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞ ,we want the values of the function $f(x)$ to get larger and larger as $x$ approaches $a$ . Instead of the requirement that |f(x)-L| < ε for arbitrarily small ε when 0<|x-a|<δ for small enough δ ，we want $f(x)>M$ for arbitrarily large positive $M$ when 0<|x-a|<δ for small enough δ Figure 2.43 illustrates this idea by showing the value of δ for successively larger values of $M$

![](./images/fWel09sPzZUyvGq1cfn0HS2CvbKKQxWn7.png)
In each graph,8is the smaller of thelengths of the two brown intervals.

Figure 2.43 These graphs plot values of δ for $M$ to show that lim_(x→a)f(x)=+∞

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be defined for all x≠a in an open interval containing a. Then, we have an infinite limit

## KEY CONCEPTS

### 2.1 A Preview of Calculus

•Differential calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of determining the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point. The slope of the tangent line indicates the rate of change of the function, also called the derivative. Calculating a derivative requires finding a limit

•Integral calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of finding the area of a region between the graph of a function and the $x$ -axis. We can approximate the area by dividing it into thin rectangles and summing the areas of these rectangles. This summation leads to the value of a function called the integral. The integral is also calculated by finding a limit and, in fact, is related to the derivative of a function

 Multivariable calculus enables us to solve problems in three-dimensional space, including determining motion in space and finding volumes of solids.

### 2.2 The Limit of a Function

•A table of values or graph may be used to estimate a limit.

•If the limit of a function at a point does not exist, it is still possible that the limits from the left and right at that point may exist.

•If the limits of a function from the left and right exist and are equal, then the limit of the function is that common value.

·We may use limits to describe infinite behavior of a function at a point

### 2.3 The Limit Laws

·The limit laws allow us to evaluate limits of functions without having to go through step-by-step processes each time. For polynomials and rational functions, lim_(x→a)f(x)=f(a)

You can evaluate the limit of a function by factoring and canceling,by multiplving by a conjugate,or by simplifying a complex fraction. The squeeze theorem allows you to find thelimit of afunctionif thefunctionis alwavs greater than one function and less than another function with limits that are known

## 2.4 Continuity

·For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and the value of the function at that point must equal the value of thelimit at that point. ·Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite ·A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints. then · The composite function theorem states: If $f(x)$ is continuous at L and lim_(x→a)g(x)=L
lim_(x→a)f(g(x)) = f(lim_(x→a)g(x)) = f(L).
•The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if a function is continuous over a closed interval, then the function takes on every value between the values at its endpoints

## 2.5 The Precise Definition of a Limit.

The intuitive notion of a limit may be converted into a rigorous mathematical definition known as the epsilon-deltc definition of thelimit. •The epsilon-delta definition may be used to prove statements about limits. •The epsilon-delta definition of a limit may be modified to define one-sided limits

## Introduction

The Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. In 2014, it reached a record-setting speed of 270.49 mph It can go from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51 seconds. The techniques in this chapter can be used to calculate the acceleration the Venom achieves in this feat (see Example 3.8.)

Calculating velocity and changes in velocity are important uses of calculus, but it is far more widespread than that. Calculus is important in all branches of mathematics, science, and engineering, and it is critical to analysis in business and health as

well. In this chapter, we explore one of the main tools of calculus, the derivative, and show convenient ways to calculate derivatives. We apply these rules to a variety of functions in this chapter so that we can then explore applications of these techniques

# 3.1 | Defining the Derivative

# Learning Objectives

3.1.1Recognize the meaning of the tangent to a curve at a point. 3.1.2Calculate the slope of a tangent line. 3.1.3 Identify the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient. 3.1.4Calculate the derivative of a given function at a point. 3.1.5Describe thevelocity as a rate of change. 3.1.6 Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity 3.1.7 Estimate the derivative from a table of values

Now that we have both a conceptual understanding of a limit and the practical ability to compute limits, we have established the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in which we compute derivatives and integrals Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton (16431727) and the German Gottfried Leibniz (16461716), whose images appear in Figure 3.2. When we credit

Newton and Leibniz with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first to understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited from the work of predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship between the two mathematicians appears to have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it seems likely that Newton did, indeed, arrive at the ideas behind calculus first, we are indebted to Leibniz for the notation that we commonly use today.

![](./images/f9bTpEcWXmDnvlIn9hIp9oXIwnW0Hz4Ur.png)
Figure 3.2 Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently

## Tangent Lines

We begin our study of calculus by revisiting the notion of secant lines and tangent lines. Recall that we used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point $( a$, $f( a) )$ to estimate the rate of change, or the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of $X$ near $a$ and drawing a line through the points $( a$, $f( a) )$ and $( x$, $f( x) )$, as shown in Figure 3.3. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the form of a difference quotient

m_(sec)=(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)

We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing $X$ with $a+h$ ,，where $h$ is a value close to O. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points $( a$, $f( a) )$ and $( a+ h$, $f( a+ h) )$ .In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with increment $h$

m_(sec)=(f(a+h)-f(a))/(a+h-a)=(f(a+h)-f(a))/h.

### Definition

Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ containing $d$ If x≠a is in $I$ ，then

Q = (f(x) - f(a))/(x - a)

### is a difference quotient.

Also.if h ≠ 0 is chosen so that $a+h$ is in $I$ ther

Q=(f(a+h)-f(a))/h

is a difference quotient with increment $h$

![](./images/fQ3TUwtW1AQQ1RYl9QZamRaOYYRbKOYgi.png)

View the development of the derivative (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_calcapplets) with this applet

These two expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are illustrated in Figure 3.3. We will see that each of these two methods for finding the slope of a secant line is of value. Depending on the setting, we can choose one or the other. The primary consideration in our choice usually depends on ease of calculation

![](./images/fOvFxDr8CYVZVa60uTfnShFZA9ipzdKws.png)
Figure 3.3 We can calculate the slope of a secant line in either of two ways.

In Figure 3.4(a) we see that, as the values of $X$ approach $a$ ,the slopes of the secant lines provide better estimates of the rate of change of the function at $d$ .Furthermore, the secant lines themselves approach the tangent line to the function at α,which represents the limit of the secant lines. Similarly, Figure 3.4(b) shows that as the values of $h$ get closer to 0, the secant lines also approach the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line at $a$ is the rate of change of the function at $a$ as shown in Figure 3.4(c)

Figure 3.4 The secant lines approach the tangent line (shown in green) as the second point approaches the first

![](./images/f86K2CFia1eOqyuFgdcwkPl3TgvUs3pXf.png)

You can use this site (http://www.openstax.org//20_diffmicros)to explore graphs to see if they have tangent line at a point.

In Figure 3.5 we show the graph of f(x) = √x and its tangent line at (1, 1) in a series of tighter intervals about $x=1$ As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear to coincide, making the values on the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function for choices of $x$ close to 1. In fact, the graph of $f(x)$ itself appears to be locally linear in the immediate vicinity of $x=1$

![](./images/fPVT5Q85XgQo7c7SdzzxyveoHwNgmgolC.png)

Formally we may define the tangent line to the graph of a function as follows.

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $u$ .The tangent line to $f(x)$ at $a$ is the line passing through the point $(a,f(a))$ having slope

m<sub>tan</sub>=lim<sub>x→a</sub>(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)

provided this limit exists.

Equivalently,wemay define the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $a$ to be the line passing through the point a $f(a)|$ having slope

m_(tan)=lim_(h→0)(f(a+h)-f(a))/h

provided this limit exists.

Just as we have used two different expressions to define the slope of a secant line, we use two different forms to define the slope of the tangent line. In this text we use both forms of the definition. As before, the choice of definition will depend on the setting. Now that we have formally defined a tangent line to a function at a point, we can use this definition to find equations of tangent lines.

# Example 3.1

### Finding a Tangent Line

Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}$ at $x=3$

### Solution

First find the slope of the tangent line.In this example,use Equation 3.3
1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1999年1
m<sub>tan</sub> = lim<sub>x→3</sub>(f(x)-f(3))/(x-3) = lim<sub>x→3</sub>(x²-9)/(x-3) = lim<sub>x→3</sub>(x-3)(x+3)/(x-3) = lim<sub>x→3</sub>(x+3) = 6

Next, find a point on the tangent line. Since the line is tangent to the graph of $f(x)$ at $x=3$ ，it passes through the point (3, $f(3)).$ We have $f(3)=9$ so the tangent line passes through the point (3, 9)

Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope $m=6$ and the point (3,9),we obtain the line $y-9=6(x-3)$ .Simplifying, we have $y=6x-9$ .The graph of $f(x)=x^{2}$ and its tangent line at 3 are shown inFiqure 3.6

## The Derivative of a Function at a Point

The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point occurs in many applications across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in business, and growth rates in biology. This limit occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the derivative. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

## Definition

Let $f(x)$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $a$ . The derivative of the function $f(x)$ at $u$ denoted by f'(a) ，is defined by

f'(a) = lim_(x→a) (f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)

provided this limit exists..

Alternatively, we may also define the derivative of $f(x)$ at a as

f'(a)=lim_(h→0)(f(a+h)-f(a))/h

## Example 3.4

Estimating a Derivative

For $f(x)=x^2$ ，use a table to estimate f'(3) using Equation 3.5.

Solution

Create a table using values of $x$ just below 3 and just above 3.

![](./images/fCgYWvZ7D2c5eC999gOknP8QQMgXtWi2P.png)

After examining the table, we see that a good estimate is f'(3)=6

![](./images/fQCVCDyQ8G04d8IOnRGewOhChemTUKyv8.png)

3.2For $f(x)=x^{2}$ , use a table to estimate f'(3) using Equation 3.6

For $f(x)=3x^{2}-4x+1$ ，find f'(2) by using Equation 3.5

### Solution

Substitute the given function and value directly into the equation.

f′(x) = lim_(x→2) (f(x)-f(2))/(x-2) Apply the definition. = lim_(x→2) (3x²-4x+1)-5/(x-2) Substitute f(x)=3x²-4x+1 and f(2)=5. = lim_(x→2) (x-2)(3x+2)/(x-2) Simplify and factor the numerator. = lim_(x→2) (3x+2) Cancel the common factor. = 8 Evaluate the limit.

## Example 3.6

### Revisiting the Derivative

For $f(x)=3x^{2}-4x+1$ ，find f'(2) by using Equation 3.6

### Solution

Using this eauation.we can substitute two yalues of the function into the eauation.and we should get the same value as in Example 3.5

Apply the definition. Substitute $f(2)=5$ and
$$f(2+h)=3(2+h)^2-4(2+h)+1.$$

f'(2) = lim_(h→0) (f(2+h)-f(2))/h = lim_(h→0) (3(2+h)²-4(2+h)+1-5)/h = lim_(h→0) (3h²+8h)/h = lim_(h→0) (h(3h+8))/h = lim_(h→0) (3h+8) = 8
Simplify the numerator. Factor the numerator. Cancel the common factor Evaluate the limit

The results are the same whether we use Equation 3.5 or Equation 3.6

# Velocities and Rates of Change.

Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if $s(t)$ is the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a time interval $[ a$, $t]$ if $t>a$ or $[t,a]$ if $t<a$ is given by the difference quotient

ν_ave = (s(t)-s(a))/(t-a)

As the values of $t$ approach $a$ ，the values of νₐᵥₑ approach the value we call the instantaneous velocity at $u$ .That is, instantaneous velocity at $a$ denoted ν(a) ，is given by

v(a) = s'(a) = lim_(t→a) (s(t)-s(a))/(t-a)

To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see Figure 3.8. In this figure, the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time $I=a$ whose position at time $t$ is given by the function $s(t)$ .The slope of the secant line (shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the time interval [a, t]

![](./images/fsFFR9PXyGtyFcNxn0GAcqx0u9faqEzEN.png)
Figure 3.8The slope of the secant line is the average velocity

over the interval [α, f]. The slope of the tangent line is the instantaneous velocity

We can use Equation 3.5 to calculate the instantaneous velocity, or we can estimate the velocity of a moving object by using a table of values. We can then confirm the estimate by using Equation 3.7.

# Example 3.7

## Estimating Velocity

A lead weight on a spring is oscillating up and down. Its position at time $t$ with respect to a fixed horizontal line is given by s(t)=sin t (Figure 3.9). Use a table of values to estimate ν(0) .Check the estimate by using Equation 3.5.

![](./images/fdGuFdSvvvRhECXVXTbG3dGqsyzS94fXG.png)

Figure 3.9 A lead weight suspended from a spring in vertical oscillatory motion.

### Solution

We can estimate the instantaneous velocity at $t=0$ by computing a table of average velocities using values of approaching 0, as shown in Table 3.1.


-0.1|a.|0.1|e.
Table 3.1

Average velocities using values of t approaching 0

From the table we see that the average velocity over the time interval [-0.1,0] is 0.998334166, the average velocity over the time interval [0.01, 0] is 0.9999833333, and so forth. Using this table of values, it appears that a good estimate is ν(0) = 1

By using Equation 3.5,we can see that

v(0)=s'(0)=lim┬(t→0)⁡(sin t - sin 0)/(t - 0) = lim┬(t→0)⁡(sin t)/t = 1

Thus, in fact, ν(0) = 1

As we have seen throughout this section, the slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous velocity are related concepts. Each is calculated by computing a derivative and each measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, or the rate of change of a function at anypoint along the function.

### Definition

The instantaneous rate of change of a function $f(x)$ at a value $a$ is its derivative f'(a)

# Example 3.8

Reaching a top speed of 270.49 mph , the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. In tests it went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.05 seconds, from 0 to 100 mph in 5.88 seconds, from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51 seconds, and from 0 to 229.9 mph in 19.96 seconds. Use this data to draw a conclusion about the rate of change of velocity (that is, its acceleration) as it approaches 229.9 mph .Does the rate at which the car is accelerating appear to be increasing, decreasing, or constant?

### Solution

First observe that 60 mph=88 ft/s, 100 mph≈146.67 146.67 ≈146.67 ft/s, 200 mph≈293.33 ft/s, and 229.9 mph ≈337.19 ft/s. We can summarize the information in a table

Now compute the average acceleration of the car in feet per second per second on intervals of the form [, 19.96] as $t$ approaches 19.96, as shown in the following table


-0.01|b.|0.01|f.
Table 3.3

Average acceleration

The rate at which the car is accelerating is decreasing as its velocity approaches 229.9 mph (337.19 ft/s).

## Example 3.9

### Rate of Change of Temperature

A homeowner sets the thermostat so that the temperature in the house begins to drop from 70°F at $9p.m$ reaches a low of 60° during the night, and rises back to 70° by 7 a.m. the next morning. Suppose that the temperature in the house is given by $T(t)=0.4t^{2}-4t+70$ for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10 ，where $t$ is the number of hours past $9p.m$ Find the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at midnight

### Solution

Since midnight is 3 hours past $9p.m$ ., we want to compute T'(3) . Refer to Equation 3.5

Apply the definition Substitute $T(t)=0.4t^{2}-4t+70$ and $T(3)=61.6$
T'(3) = lim(t→3)(T(t) - T(3))/(t - 3) = lim(t→3)(0.4t² - 4t + 70 - 61.6)/(t - 3) = lim(t→3)(0.4t² - 4t + 8.4)/(t - 3) = lim(t→3)(0.4(t - 3)(t - 7))/(t - 3) = lim(t→3)0.4(t - 7) = -1.6
Simplify
= limₜ→₃ 0.4(t-3)(t-7)/(t-3)
Cancel. Evaluate the limit

The instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at midnight is -1.6°F per hour

## Example 3.10

### Rate of Change of Profit

A toy company can sell $x$ electronic gaming systems at a price of $p=-0.01x+400$ dollars per gaming system. The cost of manufacturing $x$ systems is given by $C(x)=100x+10,000$ dollars. Find the rate of change of profit when 10,0o0 games are produced. Should the toy company increase or decrease production?

### Solution

The profit $P(x)$ earned by producing $X$ gaming systems is $R(x)-C(x)$ ，where $R(x)$ is the revenue obtained from the sale of $X$ games. Since the company can sell $X$ games at $p=-0.01x+400$ per game,

$$R(x)=xp=x(-0.01x+400)=-0.01x^{2}+400x.$$

Consequently

$$P(x)=-0.01x^{2}+300x-10,000.$$

Therefore,evaluating the rate of change of profit gives
VIV P'(10000) = lim_(x→10000)(P(x)-P(10000))/(x-10000) = lim_(x→10000)(-0.01x²+300x-10000-1990000)/(x-10000) = lim_(x→10000)(-0.01x²+300x-2000000)/(x-10000) = 100

Since the rate of change of profit P'(10000)>0 and $P(10,000)>0$ the company should increase production.

As we have seen, the derivative of a function at a given point gives us the rate of change or slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. If we differentiate a position function at a given time, we obtain the velocity at that time. It seems reasonable to conclude that knowing the derivative of the function at every point would produce valuable information about the behavior of the function. However, the process of finding the derivative at even a handful of values using the techniques of the preceding section would quickly become quite tedious. In this section we define the derivative function and learn a process for finding it.

## Derivative Functions

The derivative function gives the derivative of a function at each point in the domain of the original function for which the derivative is defined. We can formally define a derivative function as follows.

### Definition

Let $f$ be a function. The derivative function, denoted by f' , is the function whose domain consists of those values of $X$ such that the following limit exists

f'(x)=lim_(h→0)(f(x+h)-f(x))/h.

A function $f(x)$ is said to be differentiable at $a$ if f'(a) exists.More generally,a function is said to be differentiable

on $S$ if it is differentiable at every point in an open set $S$ and a differentiable function is one in which f'(x) exists on its domain.

In the next few examples we use Equation 3.9 to find the derivative of a function

## Example 3.11

 Finding the Derivative of a Square-Root Function

Find the derivative of f(x) = √x

### Solution

Start directly with the definition of the derivative function.Use Equation 3.1

![](./images/fulaxr6ffQoefNyMQA9RDKYvNhzxzdxhk.png)

## Example 3.12

Finding the Derivative of a Quadratic Function

Find the derivative of the function $f(x)=x^{2}-2x$

### Solution

Follow the same procedure here, but without having to multiply by the conjugate

AVV Substitute f(x+h)=(x+h)²-2(x+h) a f(x)=x²-2x into f'(x)=lim(h→0)[f(x+h)-f(x)]/h. Expand (x+h)²-2(x+h).
Simplify. Factor out $h$ from the numerator Cancel the common factor of $h$ Evaluate the limit.

f′(x) = lim_(h→0) (((x+h)²-2(x+h))-(x²-2x))/h = lim_(h→0) (x²+2xh+h²-2x-2h-x²+2x)/h = lim_(h→0) (2xh-2h+h²)/h = lim_(h→0) h(2x-2+h)/h = lim_(h→0) (2x-2+h) = 2x-2

![](./images/fMRtdmTm0uEQz1MbGASngrYW7m6AW0cda.png)

3.6 Find the derivative of $f(x)=x^{2}$

We use a variety of different notations to express the derivative of a function. In Example 3.12 we showed that if $f(x)=x^{2}-2x$ ，then f'(x)=2x-2 . If we had expressed this function in the form $y=x^{2}-2x$ ，we could have expressed the derivative as y' = 2x - 2 or dy/dx = 2x - 2 We could have conveyed the same information by writing d/dx(x²-2x)=2x-2 .Thus, for the function $y=f(x)$ ，each of the following notations represents the derivative of $f(x)$

f'(x), dy/dx, y', d/dx(f(x)).

In place of f'(a) we may also use dy/dx|ₓ=ₐ Use of the dy/dx notion called Leibniz notation is qute common in engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant lines are often expressed in the form Δy/Δx where Δy is the difference in the $y$ values corresponding to the differene in the $x$ values, which are expressed as Δx (Figure 3.11). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $X$ is expressed as

![](./images/frceYkDI0dC8M46sG3YKeQN45Mgeckgwk.png)
Figure 31 The derivative s expressed as dy/dx = lim Δx→0 (Δy/Δx)

# Graphing a Derivative

We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two functions, since f'(x) gives the rate of change of a function $f(x)$ (or slope of the tangent line to $f(x)$,

In Example 3.11 we found that for f(x) = √x f'(x)=1/(2√x) If we graph these functions on the same axes, as in Figure 3.12, we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that $f(x)$ is increasing over its entire domain, which means that the slopes of its tangent lines at all points are positive. Consequently, we expect f'(x) > 0 for all values of $X$ in its domain.Furthermore, as $X$ increases,the slopes of the tangent lines to $f(x)$ are decreasing and we expect to see a corresponding decrease in f'(x) .We also observe that $f(0)$ is undefined and that lim<sub>x→0⁺</sub>f′(x)=+∞ corresponding to a verical tangento $f(x)$ at 0

![](./images/ftFWcAxPMDrxIQ7lNbAgKyTfoEagu59CE.png)
Figure 3.12 The derivative f'(x) is positive everywhere

because the function $f(x)$ is increasing

In Example 3.12 we found that for $f(x)=x^{2}-2x$ 
f'(x) = 2x - 2 .The graphs of these functions are shown in Figure 3.13. Observe that $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x<1$ .For these same values of $x$ , 
f'(x) < 0 .For values of x > 1 $x>1$ $x> 1$, $f( x)$ $f(x)$ $f(x)$ is increasing and f'(x)>0 .Also, $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent at $x=1$ and f'(1)=0

![](./images/fFSbqyFsxcZeprIG2tvZDGT34t1oHPYlI.png)

Figure 3.13 The derivative f'(x) < 0 where the function $f(x)$ is decreasing and f'(x) > 0 where $f(x)$ is increasing. The derivative is zero where the function has a horizontal tangent.

## Example 3.13

### Solution

The solution is shown in the following graph. Observe that $f(x)$ is increasing and f'(x) > 0 on ( 2, 3). Also, $f(x)$ is decreasing and f'(x) < 0 on (-∞, -2) and on (3, ∞) .Also note that $f(x)$ has horizontal tangents at -2 and 3, and f'(-2)=0 and f'(3) = 0

![](./images/fP5UTGitGeUyBY8Z8vmWa0wQWEoDNWnbL.png)

## Derivatives and Continuity

Now that we can graph a derivative, let's examine the behavior of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship between differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there;

however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In fact, a function may be continuous at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons

## Theorem 3.1: Differentiability Implies Continuity

Let $f(x)$ be a function and $a$ be in its domain. If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ then $f$ is continuous at a

## Proof

If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $u$ ，then f'(a) exists and

f′(a)=limₓ→ₐ(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)

We want to show that $f(x)$ is continuous at $d$ by showing that lim_f(x)=f(a). Thus

lim_(x→a)f(x) = lim_(x→a)(f(x)-f(a)+f(a)) = lim_(x→a)((f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)*(x-a)+f(a)) = (lim_(x→a)(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a))*(lim_(x→a)(x-a))+lim_(x→a)f(a) = f'(a)*0+f(a) = f(a)

Therefore, since $f(a)$ is defined and lim_(x→a)f(x)=f(a) ，we conclude that $f$ is continuous at $u$

We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity.but now we consider whether continuity implies differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function $f(x)=|x|$ . This function is continuous everywhere; however, f'(0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply differentiability. Lets explore further. For $f(x)=|x|$

f'(0)=limₓ→₀|x|/x

Thislimit does not existbecause

limₓ→0⁻|x|/x = -1 and limₓ→0⁺|x|/x = 1.

See Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.14The function $f(x)=|x|$ is continuous at O but

is not differentiable at O.

Let's consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the functior f(x) = ³√x

f'(0) = lim (x→0) (∛x - 0)/(x - 0) = lim (x→0) 1/∛x² = +∞

Thus f'(0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f(x) = ³√x clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical tangent line at 0 (Figure 3.15)

Figure 3.15 The function f(x) = ³√x has a vertical tangent at

f'(0) = lim_(x→0) (x sin(1/x) - 0)/(x - 0) = lim_(x→0) sin(1/x).

This limit does not exist, essentially because the slopes of the secant lines continuously change direction as they approach zero (Figure 3.16)

differentiable at O.

## In summary

1.We observe that if a function is not continuous, it cannot be differentiable, since every differentiable function must be continuous. However, if a function is continuous, it may still fail to be differentiable 2.We saw that $f(x)=|x|$ failed to be differentiable at O because the limit of the slopes of the tangent lines on the left and right were not the same. Visually, this resulted in a sharp corner on the graph of the function at O. From this we conclude that in order to be differentiable at a point, a function must be “smooth” at that point. 3.As we saw in the example of f(x) = ³√x, a function fails to be differentiable at a point where there is a vertical tangent line. 4.

A Piecewise Function that is Continuous and Differentiable

A toy company wants to design a track for a toy car that starts out along a parabolic curve and then converts toa straight line (Figure 3.17).The function that describes the track is to have the form
to a suaignt nile (Piguie 3.1.) f(x)={1/10x²+bx+c if x<-10, -1/4x+5/2 if x≥-10}
where $x$ and $f(x)$ are in inches. For the car to move smoothly along the track, the function $f(x)$ must be both continuous and differentiable at -10 Find values of $b$ and $C$ that make $f(x)$ both continuous and differentiable

![](./images/fQxuGn70PhRdmETmpgAbxNTdqIvNNMGcY.png)
Figure 3.17 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the

function must be both continuous and differentiable

### Solution

For the funtion to becontiuous at x=-10, lim(x→10⁻)f(x)=f(-10) . Thus, since

lim_(x→-10⁻)f(x)=1/10(-10)²-10b+c=10-10b+c

and $f(-10)=5$ ，we must have $10-10b+c=5$ .Equivalently, we have $c=10b-5$

For the function to be differentiable at -10

f'(10)=lim_(x→-10)(f(x)-f(-10))/(x+10)

must exist. Since $f(x)$ is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this limit from the right and the left and then set them equal to each other

lim_(x→-10⁻) (f(x) - f(-10))/(x + 10) = lim_(x→-10⁻) ((1/10)x² + bx + c - 5)/(x + 10) = lim_(x→-10⁻) ((1/10)x² + bx + (10b - 5) - 5)/(x + 10) = lim_(x→-10⁻) (x² - 100 + 10bx + 100b)/(10(x + 10)) = lim_(x→-10⁻) ((x + 10)(x - 10 + 10b))/(10(x + 10)) = b - 2 

We also have

lim_(x→-10⁺)[f(x)-f(-10)]/(x+10) = lim_(x→-10⁺)[(-1/4)x+5/2-5]/(x+10) = lim_(x→-10⁺)[-(x+10)]/[4(x+10)] = -1/4

This gives us b - 2 = -1/4 Thus b = 7/4 and c=10(7/4)-5=25/2

## Higher-Order Derivatives

The derivative of a function is itself a function. so we can find the derivative of a derivative.For example,the derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of $y=f(x)$ can be expressed in any of the following forms

f''(x), f'''(x), f⁽⁴⁾(x),..., f⁽ⁿ⁾(x) y''(x), y'''(x), y⁽⁴⁾(x),..., y⁽ⁿ⁾(x) d²y/dx², d³y/dx³, d⁴y/dx⁴,..., dⁿy/dxⁿ

It isintesigto notethathe otaton fore d²y/dx² may e veveda an atep t epres d/dx(dy/dx) more compaely

Analogously,
sly, d/dx(d/dx(dy/dx)) = d/dx(d²y/dx²) = d³y/dx³.

## Example 3.15

Finding a Second Derivative

For $f(x)=2x^{2}-3x+1$ ，find f''(x)

### Solution

First find f'(x) Substitute $f(x)=2x^{2}-3x+1$ and
f(x+h)=2(x+h)²-3(x+h)+1 into f'(x)=lim_(h→0)(f(x+h)-f(x))/h

f'(x) = lim_(h→0) ((2(x+h)² - 3(x+h) + 1) - (2x² - 3x + 1))/h = lim_(h→0) (4xh + 2h² - 3h)/h = lim_(h→0) (4x + 2h - 3) = 4x - 3
Factor out the $h$ in the numeraton and cancel with the $h$ in the denominator. Take the limit.

Next, find f''(x) by taking the derivative of f'(x) = 4x - 3

f<sup>α</sup>(x) = lim<sub>h→0</sub>(f'(x+h)-f'(x))/h Use f'(x) = lim<sub>h→0</sub>(f(x+h)-f(x))/h with f'(x) in place of f(x). = lim<sub>h→0</sub>(4(x+h)-3)-(4x-3)/h  f'(x)=4x-3. Substitute f'(x+h)=4(x+h)-3 and = lim<sub>h→0</sub>4 Simplify. =4 Take the limit.

## Example 3.16

### Finding Acceleration

The position of a particle along a coordinate axis at time $t$ (in seconds) is given by $s(t)=3t^{2}-4t+1$ (ir meters). Find the function that describes its acceleration at time $t$

### Solution

Since ν(t) = s'(t) and a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t) we begin by finding the derivative of $s(t)$

s'(t)=limℎ→₀[s(t+h)-s(t)]/h =limℎ→₀[3(t+h)²-4(t+h)+1-(3t²-4t+1)]/h =6t-4.

Next,

s<sup>α</sup>(t) = lim (h→0) (s'(t+h) - s'(t))/h = lim (h→0) (6(t+h) - 4 - (6t - 4))/h = 6

Thus, a = 6 m/s²

# 3.3 | Differentiation Rules

# Learning Objectives

3.3.1 State the constant, constant multiple,and power rules. 3.3.2 Apply the sum and difference rules to combine derivatives 3.3.3 Use the product rule for finding the derivative of a product of functions. 3.3.4 Use the quotient rule for finding the derivative of a quotient of functions. 3.3.5 Extend the power rule to functions with negative exponents. 3.3.6 Combine the differentiation rules to find the derivative of a polynomial or rational function

Finding derivatives of functions by using the definition of the derivative can be a lengthy and, for certain functions, a rather challenging process. For example, previously we found that d/dx(√x) = 1/(2√x) by using a processthat involved multiplying an expression by a conjugatepriorto evaluatig imit The proces that we could use to evaluate 
13) d/dx(∛x) using the defition, while similar, is more complicated. In this section, we develop rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this process. We begin with the basics.

## The Basic Rules.

The functions $f(x)=c$ and $g(x)=x^n$ where 77 is a positive integer are the building blocks from which all polynomials and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions efficiently without resorting to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.

### The Constant Rule

We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, $f(x)=c$ .For this function, both $f(x)=C$ and $f(x+h)=c$ ,so we obtain the following result

f′(x)=lim_(h→0)(f(x+h)-f(x))/h=lim_(h→0)(c-c)/h=lim_(h→0)0/h=lim_(h→0)0=0

The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule.It states that the derivative of a constant function is zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant function is O. We restate this rule in the following theorem.

# Theorem 3.2: The Constant Rulee

Let $C$ be a constant. If $f(x)=c$ ，then f'(c)=0 Alternatively, we may express this rule as

d/dx(c)=0

## Example 3.17

### Applying the Constant Rule

Find the derivative of $f(x)=8$

### Solution

This is just a one-step application of the rule

$$f'(x)=0.$$

![](./images/f3ssAOXwbZzwy16QxRKntlbKBo0w3UbDl.png)

3.11 Find the derivative of $g(x)=-3$

### The Power Rule

We have shown that

d/dx(x²)=2x and d/dx(x¹/²)=1/2x⁻¹/²

At this point, you might see a patten begining to develop for derivatives of the form d/dx(xⁿ) . We continue oun examination of derivative formulas by differentiating power functions of the form f(x) = x' where $Tr$ is a positive integer We develop formulas for derivatives of this type of function in stages, beginning with positive integer powers. Before stating and proving the general rule for derivatives of functions of this form, we take a look at a specific case, d/dx(x³)  . As we go through this derivation, note that the technique used in this case is essentially the same as the technique used to prove the general case.

### Example 3.18

### Differentiating $x^3$

Find d/dx(x³).

### Solution

![](./images/fmA7kBoVwlXbTTCSgT7dmntgI44sIVxVo.png)

![](./images/fngSr8Gmy9r5ud8ERC0i7tCAE2leK7w1k.png)

# 3.12 Find d/dx(x⁴)

Notice that the first term in the expansionof $(x+h)^3$ is $x^{3}$ and the second term is $3x^2h$ . All other terms contain powers of $h$ that are two or greater. In this step the $x^3$ terms have been cancelled. leaving only terms containing h Factor out the common factor of $h$ After cancelling the common factor of $h$ ,the only term not containing $h$ is $3x^{2}$ Let h go to 0

As we shall see, the procedure for finding the derivative of the general form $f(x)=x^{n}$ is very similar. Although it is often unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate $f(x)=x^{3}$ ，the power on $x$ becomes the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the derivative and the power on $A$ in the derivative decreases by 1. The following theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of $X$ We will eventually extend this result to negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of $X$ and then to arbitrary powers of $X$ Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a variable power, such as $f(x)=3^{x}$

### Theorem 3.3:The Power Rule

Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $f(x)=x^{n}$ ，then

f'(x)=nxⁿ⁻¹

Alternatively,we may express this rule as

d/dx xⁿ=nxⁿ⁻¹

### Proof

For $f(x)=x^n$ where 77 is a positive integer, we have

f'(x) = lim_(h→0)((x+h)^n - x^n)/h. Since (x+h)^n = x^n + nx^(n-1)h + (n choose 2)x^(n-2)h² + (n choose 3)x^(n-3)h³ + ... + nxh^(n-1) + h^n,

we see that

(x+h)ⁿ-xⁿ=nxⁿ⁻¹h+binom(n,2)xⁿ⁻²h²+binom(n,3)xⁿ⁻³h³+...+nxhⁿ⁻¹+hⁿ.

Next, divide both sides by $h$

((x+h)^n-x^n)/h=(nx^(n-1)h+C(n,2)x^(n-2)h²+C(n,3)x^(n-3)h³+…+nxh^(n-1)+h^n)/h.

Thus,

(x+h)^n - x^n / h = nx^(n-1) + (n choose 2)x^(n-2)h + (n choose 3)x^(n-3)h^2 + ... + nxh^(n-2) + h^(n-1)

Finally,

f'(x) = lim(h→0)(nx^(n-1)+((n choose 2)x^(n-2)h)+((n choose 3)x^(n-3)h²)+…+nxh^(n-1)+h^n) = nx^(n-1)

## Example 3.19

Applying the Power Rule

### Solution

Using the power rule with $n=10$ we obtain

3.13 Find the derivative of $f(x)=x^{T}$

## The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

We find our next differentiation rules by looking at derivatives of sums, differences, and constant multiples of functions. Just as when we work with functions, there are rules that make it easier to find derivatives of functions that we add, subtract, or multiply by a constant. These rules are summarized in the following theorem.

## Theorem 3.4: Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be differentiable functions and $k$ be a constant. Then each of the following equations holds.

Sum Rule. The derivative of the sum of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the sum of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$

d/dx(f(x)+g(x))=d/dx(f(x))+d/dx(g(x))

that is,

for j(x) = f(x) + g(x), j'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)

Difference Rule. The derivative of the difference of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the difference of the

derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$

d/dx(f(x)-g(x))=d/dx(f(x))-d/dx(g(x));

that is,

for j(x) = f(x) - g(x), j'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x)

Constant Multiple Rule. The derivative of a constant $k$ multiplied by a function $f$ is the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative

d/dx(kf(x))=k d/dx(f(x));

that is,

for j(x)=kf(x), j'(x)=kf'(x).

### Proof

We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ，we set $j(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ .Using the limit definition of the derivative we have

j'(x) = lim(h→0) (j(x+h)-j(x))/h

By substituting $j(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h)$ and $j(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ ，we obtain

j'(x)=lim_(h→0)((f(x+h)+g(x+h))-(f(x)+g(x)))/h

Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have

j'(x)=lim_(h→0)((f(x+h)-f(x))/h+(g(x+h)-g(x))/h)

We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain

j'(x) = lim(h→0)((f(x+h)-f(x))/h) + lim(h→0)((g(x+h)-g(x))/h) = f'(x) + g'(x).

# Example 3.20

Applying the Constant Multiple Rule

Find the derivative of $g(x)=3x^{2}$ and compare it to the derivative of $f(x)=x^{2}$

### Solution

We use the power rule directly:

g'(x) = d/dx(3x²) = 3d/dx(x²) = 3(2x) = 6x

Since $f(x)=x^{2}$ has derivative 
f′(x)=2x we see that the derivative of $g(x)$ is 3 times the derivative of

$f(x)$ . This relationship is illustrated in Figure 3.18.

![](./images/fARxYO9eyBGnSuoEr090EhdVEeWL7rogt.png)
Figure 3.18 The derivative of $g(x)$ is 3 times the derivative of $f(x)$

### Example 3.21

Applying Basic Derivative Rules

Find the derivative of $f(x)=2x^{5}+7$

### Solution

We begin by applying the rule for differentiating the sum of two functions, followed by the rules for differentiating constant multiples of functions and the rule for differentiating powers. To better understand the sequence in which the differentiation rules are applied, we use Leibniz notation throughout the solution

f'(x) = d/dx(2x⁵ + 7) = d/dx(2x⁵) + d/dx(7) = 2d/dx(x⁵) + d/dx(7) = 2(5x⁴) + 0 = 10x⁴

### Example 3.22

Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-4x+6$ at $x=1$

### Solution

To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute

$$f(1)=1^2-4(1)+6=3.$$

This gives us the point (1, 3). Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is f'(1) ,we must first find f'(x) .Using the definition of a derivative,we have

$$f'(x)=2x-4$$

so the slope of the tangent line is f'(1)=-2 .Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the tangent line is

$$y-3=-2(x-1).$$

Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain

$$y=-2x+5.$$

## The Product Rule.

Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first one examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, the product rule does not follow this pattern. To see why we cannot use this pattern, consider the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ whose derivative is 
f′(x)=2x and not
d/dx(x) * d/dx(x) = 1 * 1 = 1.

### Theorem 3.5: Product Rule

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be differentiable functions. Then

d/dx(f(x)g(x)) = d/dx(f(x))⋅g(x) + d/dx(g(x))⋅f(x)

That is,

if j(x)=f(x)g(x), then j'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x).

This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the derivative of thesecond function times thefirst function

### Proof

We begin by assuming that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use the fact that, since $g(x)$ is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since $g(x)$ is continuous, lim_(h→0)g(x+h)=g(x)

By applying the limit definition of the derivative to $j(x)=f(x)g(x)$ ，we obtain

j'(x) = lim_(h→0) (f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x))/h

By adding and subtracting $f(x)g(x+h)$ in the numerator, we have

j'(x) = lim_(h→0) (f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x+h) + f(x)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x))/h.

After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes


j'(x) = lim(h→0) ((f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x+h))/h) + lim(h→0) (f(x)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x))/h

Rearranging, we obtain

j'(x)=lim(h→0)((f(x+h)-f(x))/h⋅g(x+h)) + lim(h→0)((g(x+h)-g(x))/h⋅f(x))

By using the continuity of $g(x)$ ，the definition of the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,and applying the limit laws, we arrive at the product rule,

j'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)

口

# Example 3.23

Applying the Product Rule to Functions at a Point

For $j(x)=f(x)g(x)$ ，use the product rule to find j'(2) if $f(2)=3$ f'(2)=-4 ， $g(2)=1$ ，and g'(2)=6

### Solution

Since jx=fxgx $j(x)=f(x)g(x)$ $j( x) = f( x) g( x)$, j'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x) and hence
$$j'(2)=f'(2)g(2)+g'(2)f(2)=(-4)(1)+(6)(3)=14.$$

# Example 3.24

## Applying the Product Rule to Binomials.

For $j(x)=(x^{2}+2)(3x^{3}-5x)$ ，find j'(x) by applying the product rule. Check the result by first finding the product and then differentiating

### Solution

If we set $f(x)=x^{2}+2$ and $g(x)=3x^{3}-5x$ ，then f'(x)=2x and g'(x)=9x²-5 .Thus,
j'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)=(2x)(3x³-5x)+(9x²-5)(x²+2)

Simplifying, we have

$$j'(x)=15x^4+3x^2-10.$$

To check, we see that $j(x)=3x^{5}+x^{3}-10x$ and, consequently, j'(x) = 15x⁴ + 3x² - 10

![](./images/fapYGCgZR80eYsbcGvFTLbY1n58iIN7Bf.png)

3.16 Use the product rule to obtain the derivative of j(x)=2x⁵(4x²+x)

## The Quotient Rule

Having developed and practiced the product rule,we now consider differentiating quotients of functions.As we see in the following theorem, the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives; rather, it is the derivative of the function in the numerator times the function in the denominator minus the derivative of the function in the denominator times the function in the numerator, all divided by the square of the function in the denominator. In order to better grasp why we cannot simply take the quotient of the derivatives, keep in mind that

d/dx(x²) = 2x, not (d/dx(x³))/(d/dx(x)) = (3x²)/1 = 3x² 

## Theorem 3.6: The Quotient Rule

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be differentiable functions. Then

d/dx(f(x)/g(x)) = (f'(x)g(x) - g'(x)f(x))/(g(x))²

That is,

if j(x)=f(x)/g(x), then j'(x)=(f'(x)g(x)-g'(x)f(x))/(g(x))²

The proof of the quotient rule is very similar to the proof of the product rule, so it is omitted here. Instead, we apply this new rule for finding derivatives in the next example

## Example 3.25

## Applying the Quotient Rule

Use theguoien ruleto in hedervaiv of k(x) = 5x²/(4x+3)

### Solution

Let $f(x)=5x^{2}$ and $g(x)=4x+3$ .Thus, 
f'(x)=10x and g'(x)=4 .Substituting into the quotient rule, we have

k'(x) = (f'(x)g(x)-g'(x)f(x))/(g(x))² = (10x(4x+3)-4(5x²))/(4x+3)²

Simplifying, we obtain

k'(x)=(20x²+30x)/(4x+3)²

![](./images/f2VwfgqOZlyzkgOozANRDNluYL8twA7rl.png)

3.17 Find the derivative of h(x)=(3x+1)/(4x-3)

It is now possible to use the quotient rule to extend the power rule to find derivatives of functions of the form $x^k$ where $k$ is a negative integer.

### Theorem 3.7: Extended Power Rule

If $k$ is a negative integer, then

d/dx(xᵏ) = kxᵏ⁻¹

### Proof

If $k$ is a negative integer, we may set $n=-k$ so that $m$ is a positive integer with $k=-m$ .Since for each positive integer n, x-" =,we may now apply the quotient rule by setting $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=x^n$ .In this case, f'(x) = 0 ano g'(x) = nxⁿ⁻¹ .Thus,

d/dx(x⁻ⁿ) = (0(xⁿ) - 1(nxⁿ⁻¹))/(xⁿ)²

Simplifying, we see that

d/dx(x⁻ⁿ)=-nx⁻ⁿ⁻¹

Finally, observe that since $k=-n$ ，by substituting we have

d/dx(xᵏ)=kxᵏ⁻¹

口

# Example 3.26

Using the Extended Power Rule

Find d/dx(x⁻⁴)

###  Solution

By applying the extended power rule with $k=-4$ ，we obtain

d/dx(x⁻⁴) = -4x⁻⁵

## Example 3.27

Using the Extended Power Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule

Use the etende powe rul an the constant mutil ruleto fn the derivaie o r f(x)=6/x².

### Solution

It may seem tempting to use the quotient rule to find this derivative, and it would certainly not be incorrect to do so. However, it is far easier to differentiate this function by first rewriting it as $f(x)=6x^{-2}$

f'(x) = d/dx(6/x²) = d/dx(6x⁻²) = 6d/dx(x⁻²) = 6(-2x⁻³) = -12x⁻³

### Combining Differentiation Rules

As we have seen throughout the examples in this section, it seldom happens that we are called on to apply just one differentiation rule to find the derivative of a given function. At this point, by combining the differentiation rules, we may find the derivatives of any polynomial or rational function. Later on we will encounter more complex combinations of differentiation rules. A good rule of thumb to use when applying several rules is to apply the rules in reverse of the order in which we would evaluate the function

### Example 3.28

Combining Differentiation Rules

For $k(x)=3h(x)+x^{2}g(x)$ ，find 
25) k'(x)

### Solution

Finding this derivative requires the sum rule, the constant multiple rule, and the product rule

Apply the sum rule Apply the constant multiple rule to
k'(x) = d/dx(3h(x)+x²g(x)) = d/dx(3h(x)) + d/dx(x²g(x)) = 3d/dx(h(x)) + (d/dx(x²)g(x) + d/dx(g(x))x²) = 3h'(x) + 2xg(x) + g'(x)x²
differentiate $3h(x)$ and the product rule to differentiate $x^{2}g(x)$

## Example 3.29

Extending the Product Rule

For $k(x)=f(x)g(x)h(x)$ express k'(x) in terms of $f(x)$ gx, h(x)and their derivatives

### Solution

We can think of the function $k(x)$ as the product of the function $f(x)g(x)$ and the function $h(x)$ .That is k(x)=(f(x)g(x))⋅h(x) .Thus,

k'(x) = (f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x))h(x) + h'(x)f(x)g(x) = f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x) + f(x)g(x)h'(x)

# Example 3.30

Combining the Quotient Rule and the Product Rule

or h(x)=2x³k(x)/(3x+2), find h'(x)

### Solution

This procedure is typical for finding the derivative of a rational function
(6x²k(x) + k'(x)·2x³)(3x+2) - 3(2x³k(x)) / (3x+2)² = (-6x³k(x) + 18x³k(x) + 12x²k(x) + 6x⁴k'(x) + 4x³k'(x)) / (3x+2)²

Apply the quotient rule. Apply the product rule to find
d/dx(2x³k(x)). Use d/dx(3x+2) = 3
Simplify.

## Example 3.31

Determining Where a Function Has a Horizontal Tangent

Determine the values of $X$ for which f(x) = x3 7x² + 8x + 1 has a horizontal tangent line

### Solution

To find the values of $X$ for which $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve f'(x) = 0 .Since

$$f'(x)=3x^{2}-14x+8=(3x-2)(x-4),$$

we must solve $(3x-2)(x-4)=0$ .Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x = ann $x=4$ as shown in the following graph.

Figure 3.19 This function has horizontal tangent lines at $x=$

2/3 and $x=4$

## Example 3.32

## Finding a Velocity

The position of an object on a coordinate axis at time $t$ is given by s(t)=t/(t²+1) What is the initial velocity o the object?

### Solution

Since the initial velocity is v(0)=s'(0) ，begin by finding 
s′(t) by applying the quotient rule:

s'(t)=(1(t²+1)-2t(t))/(t²+1)²=(1-t²)/(t²+1)².

After evaluating, we see that ν(0) = 1

# Student PROJECI

### Formula One Grandstands

Formula One car races can be very exciting to watch and attract a lot of spectators. Formula One track designers have to ensure sufficient grandstand space is available around the track to accommodate these viewers. However, car racing can be dangerous, and safety considerations are paramount. The grandstands must be placed where spectators will not be in danger should a driver lose control of a car (Figure 3.20).

![](./images/fQlpsamkLKAze9M5TT8IqwvEDTLGR87Ep.png)
Figure 3.20The grandstand next to a straightaway of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya race track, located where

the spectators are not in danger.

Safety is especially a concern on turns. If a driver does not slow down enough before entering the turn, the car may slide off the racetrack. Normally, this just results in a wider turn, which slows the driver down. But if the driver loses control completely, the car may fly off the track entirely, on a path tangent to the curve of the racetrack

Suppose you are designing a new Formula One track. One section of the track can be modeled by the function $f(x)=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x$ (Figure 3.21). The curent plan calls for grandstands to be built along the first straightaway and around a portion of the first curve. The plans call for the front corner of the grandstand to be located at the point (1.9, 2.8). We want to determine whether this location puts the spectators in danger if a driver loses control of the car.

Figure 3.21 (a) One section of the racetrack can be modeled by the function $f(x)=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x$ (b) The

front corner of the grandstand is located at (-1.9, 2.8).

1. Physicists have determined that drivers are most likely to lose control of their cars as they are coming into a turn, at the point where the slope of the tangent line is 1. Find the $(x,y)$ Coordinates of this point near the turn. 2. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at this point 3.To determine whether the spectators are in danger in this scenario,find the $x$ Coordinate of the point where the tangent line crosses the line $y=2.8$ .Is this point safely to the right of the grandstand? Or are the spectators in danger? 4.What if a driver loses control earlier than the physicists project? Suppose a driver loses control at the point (2.5, 0.625). What is the slope of the tangent line at this point? 5.If a driver loses control as described in part 4,are the spectators safe? 6.Should you proceed with the current design for the grandstand, or should the grandstands be moved?

# 3.4 | Derivatives as Rates of Change.

# Learning Objectives

3.4.1Determine a newvalue of a quantity from theold value and the amount of change 3.4.2 Calculate the average rate of change and explain how it differs from the instantaneous rate of change. 3.4.3 Apply rates of change to displacement, velocity, and acceleration of an object moving along a straight line. 3.4.4 Predict the future population from the present value and the population growth rate. 3.4.5 Use derivatives to calculate marginal cost and revenue in a business situation

In this section we look at some applications of the derivative by focusing on the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of change of a function. These applications include acceleration and velocity in physics, population growth rates in biology, and marginal functions in economics.

# Amount of Change Formula

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point together with its rate of change at the given point. If $f(x)$ is a function defined on an interval $[ a$, $a+ h]$, then the amount of change of $f(x)$ over the interval is the change in the $y$ values of the function over that interval and is given by

$$f(a+h)-f(a).$$

The average rate of change of the function $f$ over that same interval is the ratio of the amount of change over that interval to the corresponding change in the $A$ values. It is given by

(f(a+h)-f(a))/h

As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ at $d$ is its derivative

f'(a)=lim(h→0)((f(a+h)-f(a))/h).

For small enough values of $h$ , f'(a)≈(f(a+h)-f(a))/h We can then solve for $f(a+h)$ to get the amount of change formula:

f(a+h)≈f(a)+f'(a)h

We can use this formula if we know only $f(a)$ and f'(a) and wish to estimate the value of $f(a+h)$ .For example, we may use the current population of a city and the rate at which it is growing to estimate its population in the near future. As we can see in Figure 3.22, we are approximating $f(a+h)$ by the $y$ coordinate at $a+h$ on the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $X=a$ .Observe that the accuracy of this estimate depends on the value of $h$ as well as the value of f'(a)

![](./images/fmCyWflTUHpnlGbRKnz5iQ7dB9I4f1Y07.png)
Figure 3.22The new value of a changed quantity equals the

original value plus the rate of change times the interval of change: 
f(a+h)≈f(a)+f'(a)h

Here is an interesting demonstration (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_chainrule) of rate of change.

## Example 3.33

Estimating the Value of a Function

If $f(3)=2$ and f'(3)=5 ,estimate $f(3.2)$

### Solution

Begin by finding $h$ .We have $h=3.2-3=0.2$ .Thus,
f(3.2)=f(3+0.2)≈f(3)+(0.2)f'(3)=2+0.2(5)=3.

3.21 Given $f(10)=-5$ and f'(10) = 6 ,estimate $f(10.1)$

## Motion along a Line

Another use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. We have described velocity as the rate of change of position. If we take the derivative of the velocity, we can find the acceleration, or the rate of change of velocity. It is also important to introduce the idea of speed, which is the magnitude of velocity. Thus, we can state the following mathematical definitions.

### Definition

Let $s(t)$ be a function giving the position of an object at time f

The velocity of the object at time $t$ is given by ν(t) = s'(t)

The speed of the object at time $t$ is given by $|v(t)|$

The acceleration of the object at $t$ is given by a(t) = v'(t) = s'(t)

## Example 3.34

Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity

A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet.Its height above ground (in feet) $t$ seconds later is given by $s(t)=-16t^{2}+64$

![](./images/fbM4GPDvEU612RmG1kg1dGgtUMeDG9ZFx.png)
a.What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?

b. What is the average velocity during its fall?

### Solution

The first thing to do is determine how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. To do this, set $s(t)=0$ . Solving $-16t^{2}+64=0$ ,we get t = 2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.

a.The instantaneous velocity of the ball as it strikes the ground is ν(2) .Since v(t)=s'(t)=-32t we obtain ν(t)=-64 ft/s. b.The average velocity of the ball during its fall is
ν<sub>ave</sub>=(s(2)-s(0))/(2-0)=(0-64)/2=-32 fu/s.

### Example 3.35

Interpreting the Relationship between. ν(t) and $a(t)$

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in the positive direction to the right.Its position at time $t$ is given by $s(t)=t^{3}-4t+2$ .Find $v(1)$ and $a(1)$ and use these values to answer the following questions.

a.Is the particlemoving from left to right or from right toleft at time $t=1$ b.Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time $t=1$ ？

### Solution

Begin by finding ν(t) and $a(t)$

v(t)=s'(t)=3t²-4 and a(t)=v'(t)=s''(t)=6t

Evaluating these functions at $t=1$ ，we obtain ν(1) = -1 and $a(1)=6$

a.Because ν(1)<0 ,the particle is moving from right to left b.Because $v(1)<0$ and $a(1)>0$ ,velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. In other words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling causing |ν(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down

# Example 3.36

Position and Velocity

The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by $s(t)=t^{3}-9t^{2}+24t+4$ t≥0

a.Find ν(t)

b.At what time(s) is the particle at rest? C.On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right?From right to left？ d.Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle along a coordinate axis.

### Solution

a.The velocity is the derivative of the position function

ν(t) = s'(t) = 3t² - 18t + 24

b.The particle is at rest when ν(t) = 0 so set $3t^{2}-18t+24=0$ .Factoring the left-hand side of the equation produces $3(t-2)(t-4)=0$ Solving, we find that the particle is at rest at $t=2$ and $t=4$

C.The particle is moving from left to right when ν(t)>0 and from right to left when ν(t) < 0 .Figure 3.23 gives the analysis of the sign of ν(t) for t≥0 ，but it does not represent the axis along which the particle is moving

![](./images/f8SG8uS2TZhHZ5dqGXpPOGcsmYWVXmxW6.png)
Figure 3.23 The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the

particle.

Since $3t^{2}-18t+24>0$ on [0, 2)∪(2, +∞ ，the particle is moving from left to right on these intervals. Since $3t^{2}-18t+24<0$ on (2, 4), the particle is moving from right to left on this interval.

d.Before we can sketch the graph of the particle, we need to know its position at the time it starts moving $(t=0$ ) and at the times that it changes direction $(t=2$ , 4). We have $s(0)=4$ ， $s(2)=24$ ，and $s(4)=20$ . This means that the particle begins on the coordinate axis at 4 and changes direction at O and

20 on the coordinate axis. The path of the particle is shown on a coordinate axis in Figure 3.24

particle moving from right to left or from left to right at time $t=3$ ？

# Population Change

In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can use derivatives to analyze various types of populations, including those as diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population, together with a growth rate, to estimate the size of a population in the future. The population growth rate is the rate of change of a population and consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the population

## Definition

If $P(t)$ is the number of entities present in a population, then the population growth rate of $P(t)$ is defined to be 
P'(t)

## Example 3.37

# Estimating a Population

The population of a city is tripling every 5 years. If its current population is 10,000, what will be its approximate population 2 years from now?

# Solution

Let $P(t)$ be the population (in thousands) $t$ years from now. Thus, we know that $P(0)=10$ and based on the information, we anticipate $P(5)=30$ .Now estimate P'(0) ，the current growth rate, using

P'(0) ≈ (P(5)-P(0))/(5-0) = (30-10)/5 = 4

By applying Equation 3.10 to $P(t)$ ，we can estimate the population 2 years from now by writing

P(2) ≈ P(0) + (2)P'(0) ≈ 10 + 2(4) = 18

thus. in 2 years the population will be 18.000.

3.23 The current population of a mosquito colony is known to be 3,0o0; that is, $P(0)=3,000$ .If P'(0)=100 estimate the size of the population in 3 days,where $t$ is measured in days.

# Changes in Cost and Revenue

In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth, derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost revenue, and profit. The concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and economics and implies the use of derivatives.The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function.The marginal revenue is the derivative of the revenue function. The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit function, which is based on the cost function and the revenue function.

## Definition

If $C(x)$ is the cost of producing $x$ items,then the marginal cost $MC(x)$ is MC(x) = C'(x)

If $R(x)$ is the revenue obtained from selling $X$ items, then the marginal revenue $MR(x)$ is MR(x)=R'(x)

If $P(x)=R(x)-C(x)$ is the profit obtained from selling $X$ items,then the marginal profit $MP(x)$ is defined to be MP(x)=P′(x)=MR(x)-MC(x)=R′(x)-C′(x)

We can roughly approximate

MC(x) = C'(x) = limℎ→₀[C(x+h)-C(x)]/h

by choosing an appropriate value for $h$ .Since $X$ represents objects, a reasonable and small value for $h$ is 1. Thus, by substituting $h=1$ ，we get the approximation MC(x) = C'(x) ≈ C(x+1) - C(x) .Consequently, C'(x) for a given value of $X$ can be thought of as the change in cost associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way, 
MR(x) = R'(x)  approximates the revenue obtained by selling one additional item, and MP(x)=P'(x) approximates the profit obtained by producing and selling one additional item

# Example 3.38

## Applying Marginal Revenue

Assume that the number of barbeque dinners that can be sold, $X$ ,can be related to the price charged, $P$ ，bythe equation $p(x)=9-0.03x$ . 0≤x≤300

In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling $X$ barbeque dinners is given by

R(x)=xp(x)=x(9-0.03x)=-0.03x²+9x for 0≤x≤300

Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained from selling the 101st barbeque dinner Compare this to the actual revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.

## Solution

First, find the marginal revenue function: MR(x)=R'(x)=-0.06x+9

Next, use R'(100) to approximate $R(101)-R(100)$ ,the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner Since R'(100)=3 ,the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately 3$

The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is

$R(101)-R(100)=602.97-600=2.97, or 2.97.$$

The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the advantage of being easy to compute

3.24 Suppose that the profit obtained from the sale of $x$ fish-fry dinners isgiven by $P(x)=-0.03x^{2}+8x-50$ . Use the marginal profit function to estimate the profit from the sale of the 101st fish-fry dinner.

# 3.5 | Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions.

# Learning Objectives

3.5.1 Find the derivatives of the sine and cosine function.

3.5.2 Find the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions. 3.5.3 Calculate the higher-order derivatives of the sine and cosine.

One of the most important types of motion in physics is simple harmonic motion, which is associated with such systems as an object with mass oscillating on a spring. Simple harmonic motion can be described by using either sine or cosine functions. In this section we expand our knowledge of derivative formulas to include derivatives of these and other trigonometric functions. We begin with the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions and then use them to obtain formulas for the derivatives of the remaining four trigonometric functions.Being able to calculate the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions will enable us to find the velocity and acceleration of simple harmonic motion.

## Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions.

We begin our exploration of the derivative for the sine function by using the formula to make a reasonable guess at its derivative. Recall that for a function $f(x)$


f'(x) = lim(h→0) (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

Consequently for values of $h$ very close to 0, f'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x))/h We see tat by using $h=0.0$l

d/dx(sin x)≈(sin(x+0.01)-sin x)/0.01

By seting D(x)=(sin(x+0.01)-sin x)/0.01 and usin graphing uit, we can ge graphof an aproximaton t the derivative of sinx （Figure 3.25)

![](./images/fez0QN1RmU7X9MTnIwvCTGoWTbMyo7fOD.png)
Figure 3.25 The graph of the function $D(x)$ looks a lot like a

cosine curve.

Upon inspection, the graph of $D(x)$ appears to be very close to the graph of the cosine function. Indeed, we will show that

d/dx(sin x) = cos x.

If we were to follow the same steps to approximate the derivative of the cosine function, we would find that

d/dx(cosx)=-sinx

### Theorem 3.8: The Derivatives of sin x and cos x

The derivative of the sine function is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine function is the negative sine

d/dx(sin x) = cos x, d/dx(cos x) = -sin x

## Proof

Because the proofs for d/dx(sin x) = cos x and d/dx(cos x) = -sin x use similar tecniques, we provide only the proof for d/dx(sin x) = cos x . Before beginning, recal two important rigonometric limits we learned in Introduction to Limits:

lim_(h→0)(sinh/h)=1 and lim_(h→0)((cosh-1)/h)=0

The graphs of y=(sinh)/h and y=(cosh-1)/h are shown in Figure 3.26

![](./images/f7taeeM0sSmmfwMxiO25AKT9bH150Rc0X.png)
Figure 3.26 These graphs show two important limits needed to establish the derivative formulas for the

sine and cosine functions.

We also recall the following trigonometric identity for the sine of the sum of two angles

sin(x+h)=sinxcosh+cosxsinh

Now that we have gathered all the necessary equations and identities, we proceed with the proof
d/dx(sin x) = lim_(h→0) (sin(x+h) - sin x)/h = cos x

Apply the definition of the derivative Use trig identity for the sine of the sum of two angles Regroup. Factor out sin.x and cos.x. Apply trig limit formulas. Simplify

Figure 3.27 shows the relationship between the graph of f(x)=sin x and its derivative f'(x)=cos x Notice that at the points where f(x)=sin x has a horizontal tangent, its derivative f'(x)=cos x takes on the value zero. We also see that where f(x)=sin x is increasing, f'(x)=cos x>0 and where f(x)=sin x is decreasing, f'(x) = cos x < 0

f'(x) = 0 that is, f'(x) = 0 where $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent. These points are noted with dots on the graphs

## Example 3.39

Differentiating a Function Containing sin $x$

Find the derivative of f(x)=5x³sin x

### Solution

Using the product rule, we have

f'(x)=(d/dx)(5x³)(sin x)+(d/dx)(sin x)(5x³)=15x²sin x+5x³cos x

After simplifying, we obtain

f'(x) = 15x²sin x + 5x³cos x

# Example 3.40

Finding the Derivative of a Function Containing cos x

Find the derivative of g(x) = cos x / (4x²)

### Solution

By applying the quotient rule, we have

g'(x) = (-sin x)4x² - 8x(cos x)/(4x²)²

Simplifying, we obtain

g'(x)=[-4x²sin x-8xcos x]/16x⁴=[-xsin x-2cos x]/4x³

### Example 3.41

### An Application to Velocity

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time $t$ is given by s(t)=2sin t-t for 0≤t≤2π .At what times is the particle at rest'

### Solution

To determine when the particle is at rest, set s'(t)=v(t)=0 Begin by finding s'(t) .We obtain

s'(t)=2cos t-1

so we must solve

2cos t-1=0 for 0≤t≤2π

The solutions to this equation are t = π/3 and t=5π/3 . Thus the particleis at rest a times t = π/3 and t=5π/3

3.27A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s(t)=√3t+2cos t for 0≤t≤2π .At what times is the particle at rest

### Derivatives of Other Trigonometric Functions

Since the remaining four trigonometric functions may be expressed as quotients involving sine, cosine, or both, we can use the quotient rule to find formulas for their derivatives



## Finding theEquation of a Tangent Line

Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of f(x)=cot x at x=

### Solution

To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope at that point. To find the point, compute

f(π/4) = cot(π/4) = 1

Thus the tangent line passes through the point (π/4, 1). Next, find the slope by finding the derivative of f(x)=cot x and evaluating it at π/4

f'(x)=-csc²x and f'(π/4)=-csc²(π/4)=-2.

Using the point-slope equation of the line, we obtain

y-1=-2(x-π/4)

or equivalently,

y=-2x+1+π/2

## Example 3.44

### Finding the Derivative of Trigonometric Functions

Find the derivative of f(x) = csc x + x tan x .

### Solution

To find this derivative, we must use both the sum rule and the product rule. Using the sum rule, we finc

f'(x) = d/dx(csc x) + d/dx(x tan x)

In the frs term, d/dx(csc x)=-csc x cot x and by applying the productrule to the second term we obtain

d/dx(x tan x) = tan x + x sec²x.

Therefore, we have

f'(x)=-csc x cot x+tan x+x sec²x

f(x)=2tanx-3cotx

### Higher-Order Derivatives

The higher-order derivatives of sinx and cos.x follow a repeating pattern. By following the pattern, we can find any higher-order derivative of sin.x and cos.x

### Example 3.45

 Finding Higher-Order Derivatives of y = sin x

Find the first four derivatives of y = sin x

### Solution

Each step in the chain is straightforward

y = sin x, dy/dx = cos x, d²y/dx² = -sin x, d³y/dx³ = -cos x, d⁴y/dx⁴ = sin x

### Analysis

Once we recognize the pattern of derivatives, we can find any higher-order derivative by determining the step ir the pattern to which it corresponds. For example, every fourth derivative of sin $X$ equals sin x, s0

d⁴/dx⁴(sin x) = d⁸/dx⁸(sin x) = d¹²/dx¹²(sin x) = … = d⁴ⁿ/dx⁴ⁿ(sin x) = sin x; d⁵/dx⁵(sin x) = d⁹/dx⁹(sin x) = d¹³/dx¹³(sin x) = … = d⁴ⁿ⁺¹/dx⁴ⁿ⁺¹(sin x) = cos x.

## Example 3.46

### Solution

We can see right away that for the 74th derivative of sin.x, 74=4(18)+2 ，SO

d⁷⁴/dx⁷⁴(sin x) = d⁷²/dx⁷²(sin x) = d²/dx²(sin x) = -sin x.

### Example 3.47

### An Application to Acceleration

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time $t$ is given by s(t)=2-sin t. Find ν(π/4) and a(π/4) . Compare these values and decide whether the particle is speeding up or slowing down

### Solution

First find 
ν(t)=s'(t)

ν(t) = s'(t) = -cos t.

Thus,

ν(π/4) = -1/√2

Next, find a(t) = v'(t) .Thus, a(t) = ν'(t) = sin t and we have

a(π/4) = 1/√2

Since ν(π/4)=-1/√2<0 and a(π/4)=1/√2>0 , we se that velocty and aceleration ae ating in oposite directions; that is, the object is being accelerated in the direction opposite to the direction in which it is travelling Consequently, the particle is slowing down.

# 3.6 | The Chain Rule

# Learning Objectives

3.6.1State the chain rule for the composition of twofunctions. 3.6.2Apply the chain rule together with the power rule. 3.6.3 Apply the chain rule and the product/quotient rules correctly in combination when both are necessary. 3.6.4 Recognize the chain rule for a composition of three or more functions. 3.6.5 Describe theproof of the chainrule.

We have seen the techniques for differentiating basic functions ( $x^{n}$ , sinx, cos.x, etc.) as well as sums, differences, products, quotients, and constant multiples of these functions. However, these techniques do not allow us to differentiate compositions of functions, such as h(x) = sin(x³) or k(x) = √(3x² + 1) .In this section, we study the rule for finding the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.

# Deriving the Chain Rule

When we have a function that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we have already learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into simpler parts that we are able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead, we use the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function

To put this rule into context, let's take a look at an example: h(x) = sin(x³) We can think of the derivative of this function with respect to $X$ as the rate of change of sin(x³) relative to the change in λ Consequently, we want to know how sin(x³) changes as $X$ changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As $X$ changes, $x^{3}$ changes, which leads to a change in sin(x³) This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of sin(x³). First of all, a change in X forcing a change in $x^{3}$ suggests that somehow the derivative of $x^{3}$ is involved. In addition,the change in $x^3$ forcing a change in sin(x³) suggests that the derivative of sin(u) with respect to llt ，where $ll=x^{3}$ ，is also part of the final derivative

We can take a more formal look at the derivative of h(x) = sin(x³) by setting up the limit that would give us the derivative at a specific value $d$ in the domain of h(x) = sin(x³)

h'(a)=lim(x→a)(sin(x³)-sin(a³))/(x-a)

This expression does not seem particularly helpful; however, we can modify it by multiplying and dividing by the expression $x^{3}-a^{3}$ to obtain

h'(a) = limₓ→ₐ (sin(x³) - sin(a³))/(x³ - a³) * (x³ - a³)/(x - a)

From the definition of the derivative, we can see that the second factor is the derivative of $x^{3}$ at $A=ld$ .That is.

lim_(x→a) (x³-a³)/(x-a) = d/dx(x³)|_(x=a) = 3a²

However, it might be a little more challenging to recognize that the first term is also a derivative. We can see this by letting $u=x^{3}$ and observing that as x→a X→a x → a, u → a³ u → a³ u →a3

lim_(x→a)(sin(x³)-sin(a³))/(x³-a³)=lim_(u→a³)(sin u-sin(a³))/(u-a³)=(d/du)(sin u)|_(u=a³)=cos(a³)

# Thus, h'(a) = cos(a³) ⋅ 3a²

In other words, if h(x)=sin(x³), then 
h′(x)=cos(x³)•3x² .Thus, if we think of h(x)=sin(x³) as the composition (f∘g)(x)=f[g(x)] where $f( x) =$ sin $x$ and $g(x)=x^{3}$ ， then the derivative of h(x)=sin(x³) is the product of the derivative of $g(x)=x^3$ and the derivative of the function f(x)=sin x evaluated at the function $g(x)=x^{3}$ .At this point, we anticipate that for h(x)=sin(g(x)) ，it is quite likely that h'(x) = cos(g(x))g'(x) .As we determined above, this is the case for h(x) = sin(x³)

Now that we have derived a special case of the chain rule, we state the general case and then apply it in a general form to other composite functions. An informal proof is provided at the end of the section.

## Rule: The Chain Rule

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions. For all $X$ in the domain of $g$ for which $g$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(x)$ ,， the derivative of the composite function

h(x)=(fog)(x)=f(g(x))

is given by

h′(x)=f′(g(x))g′(x)

Alternatively, if $y$ is a function of $Lt$ and $ll$ is a function of X X $x$, then

dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx

# Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying the Chain Rulee

1. To differentiate $h(x)=f(g(x)$ ,. begin by identifying $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ 2.Find f'(x) and evaluate it at $g(x)$ to obtain f'(g(x)) 3. Find g'(x) 4.Write h′(x) = f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)

 Note: When applying the chain rule to the composition of two or more functions, keep in mind that we work our way from the outside function in. It is also useful to remember that the derivative of the composition of two functions can be thought of as having two parts; the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts; and so on. Also, remember that we never evaluate a derivative at a derivative.

### The Chain and Power Rules Combined.

We can now apply the chain rule to composite functions, but note that we often need to use it with other rules. For example, to find derivatives of functions of the form h(x) = (g(x))'ⁿ ,we need to use the chain rule combined with the power rule. To

do so, we can think of h(x)=(g(x))'' as $f(g(x))$ where $f(x)=x^{n}$ Then f'(x) = nxⁿ⁻¹ .Thus, f'(g(x))=n(g(x))ⁿ⁻¹ This leads us to the derivative of a power function using the chain rule,


h'(x) = n(g(x))ⁿ⁻¹g'(x)

### Rule:Power Rule for Composition of Functions

For all values of $X$ for which the derivative is defined, if

$$h(x)=(g(x))^{n}.$$

Then

h'(x)=n(g(x))ⁿ⁻¹g'(x)

Example 3.48

Using the Chain and Power Rules.

FEn de eriate h(x)=1/(3x²+1)²

### Solution

Fis terie h(x)=1/(3x²+1)²=(3x²+1)^-2

 Applying the power rule with $g(x)=3x^{2}+1$ ,we have

h'(x) = -2(3x² + 1)⁻³(6x)

Rewriting back to the original form gives us

h'(x) = -12x/(3x² + 1)³.

3.34 Find the derivtive of h(x)=(2x³+2x-1)⁴

## Example 3.49

Using the Chain and Power Rules with a Trigonometric Function

Find the derivative of h(x) = sin³x

### Solution

First recall that sin³x = (sinx)³ ，so we can rewrite h(x) = sin³x as h(x)=(sin x)

Applying the power rule with g(x) = sin x ，we obtain

h'(x) = 3(sin x)²cos x = 3sin²x cos x

## Example 3.50

Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

Find the quation of line tangen tothe graph of h(x)=1/(3x-5)² at $x=2$

### Solution

Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The $X$ -Coordinate of the point is 2. To find the y-coordinate, substitute 2 into $h(x)$ .Since h(2)=1/(3(2)-5)²=1 ， the point is (2. 1

For the slope, we need h'(2) . To find h'(x) ，first we rewrite $h(x)=(3x-5)^{-2}$ and apply the power rule to obtain

$$h'(x)=-2(3x-5)^{-3}(3)=-6(3x-5)^{-3}.$$

By substituting, we have h'(2) = -6(3(2)-5)⁻³ = -6 Therefore, the line has equation $y-1=-6(x-2)$ Rewriting, the equation of the line is $y=-6x+13$

3.35 Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f(x)=(x²-2)³ at $x=-2$

## Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules

Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule. we examine how to combine the chain rule with the other rules we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric functions or with the product rule

## Example 3.51

### Using the Chain Rule on a General Cosine Function

Find the derivative of 
4) h(x) = cos(g(x))

### Solution

Thinkof 
4) h(x) = cos(g(x)) as $f[g(x)]$ where f(x)=cos x .Since f′(x)=-sin x wehave f'(g(x))=-sin(g(x)) Then we do the following calculation

h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) Apply the chain rule. = -sin(g(x))g'(x) Substitute f'(g(x)) = -sin(g(x)).

Thus, the derivative of 
4) h(x) = cos(g(x)) is given by h'(x)=-sin(g(x))g'(x)

In the following example we apply the rule that we have just derived.

# Example 3.52

Using the Chain Rule on a Cosine Function

Find the derivative of h(x)=cos(5x²)

### Solution

Let $g(x)=5x^{2}$ . Then g′(x)=10x Using the result from the previous example,

h'(x) = -sin(5x²)⋅10x = -10xsin(5x²).

# Example 3.53

Using the Chain Rule on Another Trigonometric Function.

Find the derivative of h(x)=sec(4x⁵+2x)

### Solution

Apply the chain rule to h(x)=sec(g(x)) to obtain

h'(x) = sec(g(x))tan(g(x))g'(x)

In this problem, $g(x)=4x^{5}+2x$ ，so we have g'(x) = 20x⁴ + 2 Therefore, we obtain

h'(x) = sec(4x⁵+2x)tan(4x⁵+2x)(20x⁴+2) =(20x⁴+2)sech(4x⁵+2x)tan(4x⁵+2x).

![](./images/fpMu7fGERUuFK9GaKwDSr5RFAshYNDMze.png)

3.36 Find the derivative of 
h(x)=sin(7x+2)

At this point we provide a list of derivative formulas that may be obtained by applying the chain rule in conjunction with the formulas for derivatives of trigonometric functions.Their derivations are similar to those used in Example 3.51 and Example 3.53.For convenience, formulas are also given in Leibniz's notation, which some students find easier to remember. (We discuss the chain rule using Leibniz's notation at the end of this section.) It is not absolutely necessary to memorize these as separate formulas as they are all applications of the chain rule to previously learned formulas.

### Theorem 3.10: Using the Chain Rule with Trigonometric Functions

![](./images/f0TlqpRdVKkGQPQQcQpPP1fHnEuWyEy3h.png)

# Example 3.54

Combining the Chain Rule with the Product Rule

Find the derivative of $h(x)=(2x+1)^{5}(3x-2)^{7}$

### Solution

First apply the product rule, then apply the chain rule to each term of the product
h'(x) = d/dx((2x+1)^5)⋅(3x-2)^7 + d/dx((3x-2)^7)⋅(2x+1)^5 = 10(2x+1)^4(3x-2)^7 + 21(3x-2)^6(2x+1)^5 = (2x+1)^4(3x-2)^6(72x+1)

3.37 in he deivaive of h(x)=x/(2x+3)³

# Composites of Three or More Functions

We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating the composition of three or more functions.we need to apply the chain rule more than once.If we look at this situation in general terms, we can generate a formula, but we do not need to remember it, as we can simply apply the chain rule multiple times.

In general terms, first we let

$$k(x)=h(f(g(x))).$$

Then, applying the chain rule once we obtain

k'(x) = d/dx(h(f(g(x))) = h'(f(g(x))) * d/dx f(g(x))

Applying the chain rule again, we obtain

$$k'(x)=h'(f(g(x))f'(g(x))g'(x)).$$

## Rule: Chain Rule for a Composition of Three Functions

For all values of $X$ for which the function is differentiable, if

$$k(x)=h(f(g(x))),$$

then

k'(x) = h'(f(g(x)))f'(g(x))g'(x)

In other words, we are applying the chain rule twice.

Notice that the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts. (Similarly, the derivative of the composition of four functions has four parts,and so on.)Also,remember,we can always work from the outside in, takinq one derivative at a time.

## Example 3.55

Differentiating a Composite of Three Functions

Find the derivative of k(x)=cos⁴(7x²+1)

# Solution

First, rewrite $k(x)$ as

k(x) = (cos(7x²+1))⁴

Then apply the chain rule several times.
k'(x) = 4(cos(7x²+1))³(-sin(7x²+1))(14x) = -56xsin(7x²+1)cos³(7x²+1)

![](./images/fcQxcmlKASmg7kRw1OqiGtpuL5Ga0XgAw.png)

3.38 Find the derivative of h(x) = sin⁶(x³).

## Example 3.56

### Using the Chain Rule in a Velocity Problem

A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time $t$ is given by s(t) = sin(2t) + cos(3t) .What is the velocity of the particle at time t=π/6

## Solution

To find ν(t) ，the velocity of the particle at time $f$ we must differentiate $s(t)$ .Thus

ν(t)=s'(t)=2cos(2t)-3sin(3t)

Substituting t =into ν(t) ，we obtain v=-2

![](./images/fguMf7G7G34Bc8RTP2S3fyMDiO2yRrIId.png)

3.39 A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time $t$ is given by s(t) = sin(4t) .Find its acceleration at time $f$

### Proof

At this point, we present a very informal proof of the chain rule. For simplicity’s sake we ignore certain issues: For example we assume that g(x)≠g(a) for x≠a in some open interval containing $a$ .We begin by applying the limit definition of the derivative to the function $h(x)$ to obtain h'(a)


h'(a) = lim_(x→a) (f(g(x)) - f(g(a)))/(x - a)

Rewriting, we obtain

h'(a) = limₓ→ₐ (f(g(x)) - f(g(a)))/(g(x) - g(a)) * (g(x) - g(a))/(x - a)

Although it is clear that

lim_(x→a)(g(x)-g(a))/(x-a)=g'(a)

it is not obvious that

lim(x→a)(f(g(x))-f(g(a)))/(g(x)-g(a))=f'(g(a)).

To see that this is true, first recall that since $g$ is differentiable at $a$ a $a,g$ g $g$ is also continuous at $d$ .Thus

limₓ→ₐg(x)=g(a)

Next, make the substitution $y=g(x)$ and $b=g(a)$ and use change of variables in the limit to obtain

lim_(x→a)(f(g(x))-f(g(a)))/(g(x)-g(a))=lim_(y→b)(f(y)-f(b))/(y-b)=f'(b)=f'(g(a)).

Finally,

h'(a) = lim_(x→a)[f(g(x))-f(g(a))]/[g(x)-g(a)]*[g(x)-g(a)]/(x-a) = f'(g(a))g'(a)

口

## Example 3.57

fg(1)=4, g'(1)=3, and f'(4)=7, find h'(1).

### Solution

1888888881
h'(1) = f'(g(1))g'(1)  Apply the chain rule.
= f'(4)⋅3 Substitute g(1)=4 and g'(1)=3.
= 7⋅3 Substitute f'(4)=7.
Simplify.

3.40Given $h(x)=f(g(x))$ If $g(2)=-3$ g'(2) = 4 ，and f'(-3) = 7 ，find h'(2)

## The Chain Rule Using Leibniz's Notation

As with other derivatives that we have seen. we can express the chain rule using Leibniz's notation. This notation for the chain rule is used heavily in physics applications.

For $h(x)=f(g(x))$, let $ll=g(x)$ and $y=h(x)=f(u)$ .Thus,

h'(x)=dy/dx, f'(g(x))=f'(u)=dy/du and g'(x)=du/dx.

Consequently,

dy/dx = h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = dy/du * du/dx

### Rule: Chain Rule Using Leibniz's Notation

If $y$ is a function of $lt$ ，and $lu$ is a function of $X$ ，then

dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx

## Example 3.58

Taking a Derivative Using Leibniz's Notation, Example 1

Find the erivatie of y = (x/(3x+2))⁵

### Solution

First, let u=x/(3x+2) Thus, $y=u^5$ . Next, find du/dx and dy/du Using the quotiet rule

du/dx=2/(3x+2)²

and

dy/du=5u⁴

Finally, we put it all together.
dy/dx = (dy/du)(du/dx) = 5u⁴(2/(3x+2)²) = 5(x/(3x+2))⁴(2/(3x+2)²) = 10x⁴/(3x+2)⁶

It is important to remember that.when using the Leibniz form of the chain rule.the final answer must be expressed entirely in terms of the original variable given in the problem

## Example 3.59

Taking a Derivative Using Leibniz's Notation, Example 2

Find the derivative of y=tan(4x²-3x+1)

### Solution

First, let $u=4x^{2}-3x+1$ . Then y=tan u . Next, find du/dx and dy/du

du/dx = 8x - 3 and dy/du = sec²u.

Finally, we put it all together.
dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx = sec²(u)*(8x-3) = sec²(4x²-3x+1)*(8x-3)

Z

3.41 Use Leibniz's notation to find the derivative of y=cos(x³) .Make sure that the final answer i expressed entirely in terms of the variable $x$

# 3.7 | Derivatives of Inverse Functions

# Learning Objectives

3.7.1 Calculate the derivative of an inverse function.

3.7.2 Recognize the derivatives of the standard inverse trigonometric functions

In this section we explore the relationship between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse. For functions whose derivatives we already know, we can use this relationship to find derivatives of inverses without having to use the limit definition of the derivative. In particular, we will apply the formula for derivatives of inverse functions to trigonometric functions. This formula may also be used to extend the power rule to rational exponents.

# The Derivative of an Inverse Function

We begin by considering a function and its inverse. If $f(x)$ is both invertible and differentiable, it seems reasonable that the inverse of $f(x)$ is also differentiable. Figure 3.28 shows the relationship between a function $f(x)$ and its inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ . Look at the point  (a, f⁻¹(a))  on the graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ having a tangent line with a slope of (f⁻¹)'(a) = p/q This point corresponds to a point (f⁻¹(a), a) on the graph of $f(x)$ having a tangent line with a slope of f'(f1 (a)) = Thus, if $f^{-1}(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ ，then it must be the case that

![](./images/fOGNNHESSCcocXr5GfUCmiCsVQgoFzOTO.png)
Figure 3.28 The tangent lines of a function and its inverse are

related; so, too, are the derivatives of these functions.

We may also derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse by first recalling that x=f(f⁻¹(x)) Then by differentiating both sides of this equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain

1=f'(f⁻¹(x))(f⁻¹)'(x)

Solving for (f⁻¹)'(x) ，we obtain

(f⁻¹)'(x)=1/(f'(f⁻¹(x)))

We summarize this result in the following theorem.

### Theorem 3.11: Inverse Function Theorem

Let $f(x)$ be a function that is both invertible and differentiable. Let $y=f^{-1}(x)$ be the inverse of $f(x)$ .For all $x$ satisfying f'(f⁻¹(x))≠0

dy/dx=d/dx(f⁻¹(x))=(f⁻¹)'(x)=1/(f'(f⁻¹(x))).

Alternatively, if. $y=g(x)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$ ，then

g'(x)=1/f'(g(x))

### Example 3.60

Applying the Inverse Function Theorem

Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivativeof g(x)=(x+2)/x Compare the resulting derivative to that obtained by differentiating the function directly.

### Solution The ivese of g(x) = (x+2)/x is f(x)=2/(x-1) Sice g'(x)=1/f'(g(x)), begin fndig f'(x) Thus

f'(x) = -2/(x-1)² and f'(g(x)) = -2/((x+2)/x - 1)² = -x²/2

Finally,

g'(x) = 1/f'(g(x)) = -2/x²

We can verify that this is the correct derivative by applying the quotient rule to $g(x)$ to obtain

g'(x)=-2/x²

M

3.42Use theinverse funtion theorem tofind the derivative of g(x) = 1/(x+2) . Compare the result obtainec by differentiating $g(x)$ directly.

### Example 3.61

### Applying the Inverse Function Theorem.

Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of g(x)=∛x

### Solution

The function g(x)=∛x is the inverse of the function $f(x)=x^{3}$ . Since g′(x)=1/f′(g(x)), begin by finding f'(x) .Thus,

f'(x)=3x² and f'(g(x))=3(∛x)²=3x²/³

Finally,

g'(x)=1/(3x^(2/3))=(1/3)x^(-2/3)

![](./images/f6XOYfBfemHzRSaEEf9RBpisCohBGIhOL.png)

3.43 Find the derivative of g(x)=⁵√x by applying the inverse function theorem

From the previous example,we see that we can use the inverse function theorem to extend the power rule to exponents of the form 1/n where $n$ is a positive integer. This extension will ultimately allow us to differentiate $x^q$ ，where $q$ is any rational number.

### Theorem 3.12: Extending the Power Rule to Rational Exponents

The power rule may be extended to rational exponents. That is, if $n$ is a positive integer,then

d/dx(x^(1/n)) = (1/n)x^((1/n)-1)

Also, if $n$ is a positive integer and 177 is an arbitrary integer, ther

d/dx(x^(m/n)) = (m/n)x^((m/n)-1)

### Proof

Th functon $g(x)=x^{1/n}$ is h iveie f e uncioon $f(x)=x^{n}$ Since g'(x)=1/f'(g(x)), begin b findig f'(x) Thus,

f'(x)=nxⁿ⁻¹ and f'(g(x))=n(x<sup>1/n</sup>)ⁿ⁻¹=nx<sup>(n-1)/n</sup>

Finally,

g'(x)=1/(nx<sup>(n-1)/n</sup>)=x<sup>(1-n)/n</sup>/n=x<sup>(1/n)-1</sup>/n.

To differentiate $x^{m/n}$ we must rewrite it as (x¹/ⁿ)ᵐ and apply the chain rule. Thus

d/dx(xᵐ/ⁿ) = d/dx((x¹/ⁿ)ᵐ) = m(x¹/ⁿ)ᵐ⁻¹ · (1/n)x⁽¹/ⁿ⁾⁻¹ = m/nx⁽ᵐ/ⁿ⁾⁻¹

# Example 3.62

Applying the Power Rule to a Rational Power.

Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of $y=x^{2/3}$ at $x=8$

### Solution

First find dy/dx and evaluate it at $x=8$ . Since

dy/dx = (2/3)x⁻¹/³ and dy/dx|_(x=8) = 1/3

the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $x=8$ is 1/3

Substituting $x=8$ into the original function.we obtain $y=4$ Thus. the tangent line passes through the poin (8, 4). Substituting into the point-slope formula for a line, we obtain the tangent line

y=⅓x+4/3

## Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

We now turn our attention to finding derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. These derivatives will prove invaluable in the study of integration later in this text. The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are quite surprising in that their derivatives are actually algebraic functions. Previously, derivatives of algebraic functions have proven to be algebraic functions and derivatives of trigonometric functions have been shown to be trigonometric functions. Here, for the first time, we see that the derivative of a function need not be of the same type as the original function

# Example 3.63

Derivative of the Inverse Sine Function

Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of g(x) = sin⁻¹x

### Solution

Since for $x$ in the interval [-π/2,π/2], f(x)=sin x is the inverse of g(x) = sin⁻¹x ，begin by finding f'(x) Since

f'(x)=cos x and f'(g(x))=cos(sin⁻¹x)=√(1-x²)

we see that

g'(x)=d/dx(sin⁻¹x)=1/(f'(g(x)))=1/√(1-x²).

### Analysis

To see that cos(sin⁻¹x) = √(1 - x²) consider the following argument. Set sin⁻¹x=θ In this case, sinθ = x where -π/2≤θ≤π/2. We begin by considering the case where 0<θ<n/2 Since θ is an acute angle, we may construct a right triangle having acute angle θ a hypotenuse of length 1 and the side opposite angle θ having length $X$ From thePythagorean theorem,the side adjacent to angle θ has length √(1-x²) .This triangle is shown in Figure 3.29.Using thetriangle, we seethat cos(sin⁻¹x) = cos θ = √(1 - x²)

![](./images/fFPhoGRk72HiNXwOeEGobZzBVCgF1PWSM.png)

Figure 3.29 Using a right triangle having acute angle θ ,a hypotenuse of length 1, and the side opposite angle θ having length $x$ ，we can see that cos(sin⁻¹x) = cos θ = √(1 - x²)

In the case where -π/2<θ<0 ,we make the observation that 0<-θ<π/2 and hence

cos(sin⁻¹x) = √(1-x²)

Now if θ=π/2 or θ=-π/2 $x=1$ or $x=-1$ ,and since in either case cos θ = 0 and ⁴√(1-x²) = 0 we have


cos(sin⁻¹x) = cosθ = √(1 - x²)

Finally, if 0 = - θ = . θ=-, $x= 0$ x = 0 $x=0$ and cosθ = ⁿ√1 = 1

Consequently, in ll ases, cos(sin⁻¹x)=√(1-x²)

## Example 3.64

### Applying the Chain Rule to the Inverse Sine Function

Apply the chain rule to the formula derived in Example 3.61 to find the derivative of h(x) = sin⁻¹(g(x)) and use this result to find the derivative of h(x)=sin⁻¹(2x³)

### Solution

Applying the chain rule to h(x)=sin⁻¹(g(x)), we have

h'(x)=1/√(1-(g(x))²)g'(x)

Now let g(x) = 2x² $g(x)=2x^{3}$ $g( x) = 2x^{3}$, so
g'(x)=6x² g'(x) = 6x² g′(x) = 6.x² .Substituting into the previous result, we obtain


h'(x) = 1/√(1-4x⁶) * 6x² = 6x²/√(1-4x⁶)

![](./images/fHlLANdL6HHs9g4r4xb3TXtCabUTF0B9X.png)

3.45Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of g(x) = tan⁻¹x

The derivatives of the remaining inverse trigonometric functions may also be found by using the inverse function theorem. These formulas are provided in the following theorem.

## Example 3.65

Applying Differentiation Formulas to an Inverse Tangent Function

Find the derivative of f(x)=tan⁻¹(x²)

### Solution

Let $g(x)=x^2$ g(x) = x2 $g( x) = x^{2}$, sog'(x) = 2x g’(x)= 2x g'(x)=2x .Substituting into Equation 3.24, we obtain

f'(x) = 1/(1 + (x²)²) ⋅ (2x).

Simplifying, we have

f'(x) = 2x/(1+x⁴).

## Example 3.66

Applying Differentiation Formulas to an Inverse Sine Function

Find the derivative of h(x)=x²sin⁻¹x

## Solution

By applying the product rule, we have

h'(x) = 2x sin⁻¹x + x²/√(1-x²)

![](./images/fxSLTUIDIUgqTXb5qLov8c7W6TVrLEHMd.png)

3.46 Find the derivative of h(x)=cos⁻¹(3x-1)

## Example 3.67

Applying the Inverse Tangent Function.

The position of a particle at time $t$ is given by s(t) = tan⁻¹(1/t) for t ≥ 1/2 Find the velocity of the particle at time $t=1$

### Solution

Begin by differentiating $s(t)$ in order to find ν(t) .Thus

v(t)=s'(t)=-1/(t²(1+(1/t)²))

Simplifying, we have

v(t) = -1/(t²+1)

Thus, ν(1) = -1/2

# 3.8 | Implicit Differentiation.


3|-5

We have already studied how to find equations of tangent lines to functions and the rate of change of a function at a specific point. In all these cases we had the explicit equation for the function and differentiated these functions explicitly. Suppose instead that we want to determine the equation of a tangent line to an arbitrary curve or the rate of change of an arbitrary curve at a point. In this section, we solve these problems by finding the derivatives of functions that define $y$ implicitly in terms of $x$

# Implicit Differentiation.

In most discussions of math, if the dependent variable $y$ is a function of the independent variable $x$ we express y in terms of $X$ If this is the case, we say that $y$ is an explicit function of $X.$ For example, when we write the equation $y=x^{2}+1$ we are defining y explicitly in terms of $X.$ On the other hand, if the relationship between the function $y$ and the variable $X$ is expressed by an equation where $y$ is not expressed entirely in terms of $X$ ,we say that the equation defines $y$ implicitly in terms of $A$ .For example, the equation $y-x^{2}=1$ defines the function $y=x^{2}+1$ implicitly

Implicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the vertical line test). We are using the idea that portions of $y$ are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that $y$ is not actually a function of $X$

In general, an equation defines a function implicitly if the function satisfies that equation. An equation may define many different functions implicitly. For example, the functions.

which are illustrated in Figure 3.30, are just three of the many
y=√(25-x²) and y={√(25-x²) if -5<x<0, -√(25-x²) if 0<x<25},
functions defined implicitly by the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$

![](./images/fmfsFzVlR7eKXlNNiuUkRFwETdduoA33d.png)
Figure 3.30 The equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ defines many functions implicitly

If we want to find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ at the point (3, 4),we could evaluate the derivative of the function y=√(25-x²) at $x=3$ .On the other hand, if we want the slope of the tangent line at the point (3, 4), we could use the derivative of y=-√(25-x²) However, it is not always easy to solve for a function defined implicitly by an equation. Fortunately, the technique of implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of an implitly defined function without ever solving for the function explitly The proces of finding dy/dx using implicit differentiation is described in the following problem-solving strategy

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Implicit Differentiatior

To perform implicit differentiation on an equation that defines a function $y$ implicitly in terms of a variable $x$ use the following steps:

1.Take the derivative of both sides of the equation. Keep in mind that y is a function of $x$ . Consequently, whereas d/dx(sin x)=cos x; d/dx(sin y)=cos y dy/dx because we mutuse the han ruleto dfferertate sin y with respece to $X$ 2. Rewritethe equaion so tha a term ontaining dy/dx are on the lef an al termn that o no ontain dy/dx are on the right. 3. Factor out dy/dx on the left. 4. Solve for dy/dx by dividing hoth sidesof thequation by an apropriae algebraic expreson

### Example 3.68

### Using Implicit Differentiation

Assuming that $y$ is defined implicitly by the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ ，find 

### Solution

Follow the steps in the problem-solving strategy
d/dx(x²+y²) = d/dx(25), d/dx(x²) + d/dx(y²) = 0, 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0, 2y(dy/dx) = -2x, dy/dx = -x/y

Step 1. Differentiate both sides of the equation. Step 1.1. Use the sum rule on the left. On the rig htd/dx(25) = 0 Step 1.2. Take the derivatives, so d/dx(x²)=2x

and d/dx(y²) = 2y(dy/dx)
Step 2. Keep the terms with dy/dx on the left Move the remaining terms to the right. Step 4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2y. (Step 3 does not apply in this case.)

### Analysis

Not that the resultin expression for dy/dx is in terms of boththe independent variable $x$ and the dependent varable $y.$ Although in some case it may be posible t epres s dy/dx in terms of $x$ only i is generaly non possible to do so.

### Example 3.69

Using Implicit Differentiation and the Product Rule

Assuming that $y$ is defined implicily by the equation x³sin y + y = 4x + 3 ，find

Solution: (d/dx)(x³sin y + y) = (d/dx)(4x + 3)
(d/dx)(x³sin y) + (d/dx)(y) = 4
(d/dx)(x³).sin y + (d/dx)(sin y).x³ + dy/dx = 4
3x²sin y + (cos y(dy/dx)).x³ + dy/dx = 4
x³cos y(dy/dx) + dy/dx = 4 - 3x²sin y
dy/dx(x³cos y + 1) = 4 - 3x²sin y
dy/dx = (4 - 3x²sin y)/(x³cos y + 1)

Step 1: Differentiate both sides of the equation Step 1.1: Apply the sum rule on the left. On the right. d/dx(4x+3)=4 Step 1.2: Use the product rule to find
d/dx(x³sin y). Observe that d/dx(y) = dy/dx.
Step 1.3: We know d/dx(x³) = 3x² Use the chain rle to btain d/dx(sin y) = cos y dy/dx Step 2: Keepalterms containing dy/dx onthe left. Move all other terms to the right. Step 3: Factor out dy/dx on the left Step 4: Solve for dy/dx by dividing boh sides of the equation by x³cosy+1

### Example 3.70

Using Implicit Differentiation to Find a Second Derivative

Find d²y/dx² if x²+y²=25.

### Solution

In Example 3.68, we showed that dy/dx=-x/y We can takethe derivativeof hoth sides of this equaion to find
d²y/dx².

d²y/dx² = d/dy(-x/y) = -(y - x(dy/dx))/y² = (-y + x(dy/dx))/y² = (-y + x(-x/y))/y² = (-y² - x²)/y³

### Finding Tangent Lines Implicitly

Now that we have seen the technique of implicit differentiation, we can apply it to the problem of finding equations of tangent lines to curves described by equations.

### Example 3.71

### Finding a Tangent Line to a Circle

Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ at the point (3,—4)

### Solution

Although we could find this equation without using implicit differentiation, using that method makes it much easier. In Example 3.68, we found dy/dx=-x/y

The slope of the tangent line is found by substituting (3, —4) into this expression. Consequently, the slope of the tangen ie is dy/dx|(₃, -₄)=-3/-4=¾

Using the point (3,-4) and theslope 3/4 in the point-slope equation of the line, we obtain the equation y = (3/4)x - 25/4 (Figure 3.31)

### Solution

Begin by finding dy/dx

d/dx(y³+x³-3xy) = d/dx(0); 3y²dy/dx+3x²-(3y+dy/dx 3x) = 0; dy/dx = (3y-3x²)/(3y²-3x).

Next suste (3/2, 3/2) into dy/dx = (3y-3x²)/(3y²-3x) to in he sle o thetangen line

Finally, substitute into the point-slope equation of the line to obtain

### Example 3.73

### Applying Implicit Differentiation

In a simple video game, a rocket travels in an elliptical orbit whose path is described by the equation $4x^{2}+25y^{2}=100$ . The rocket can fire missiles along lines tangent to its path. The object of the game is to destroy an incoming asteroid traveling along the positive $x$ -axis toward (O, O). If the rocket fires a missile when it is located at (3, 8/5) where will it intersect the $x$ -axis?

### Solution

To solve this problem, we must determine where the line tangent to the graph of

$4x^{2}+25y^{2}=100$ at (3, 8/5) intersects the $X$ -axis Begin by finding dy/dx implicitly

Differentiating, we have

 8x + 50y(dy/dx) = 0 

Solving for dy/dx we have

dy/dx=-4x/(25y)

# 3.9 | Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic

## Functions

# Learning Objectives.

3.9.1 Find the derivative of exponential functions. 3.9.2 Find the derivative of logarithmic functions. 3.9.3 Use logarithmic differentiation to determine the derivative of a function.

So far, we have learned how to differentiate a variety of functions, including trigonometric, inverse, and implicit functions. In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in Introduction to Functions and Graphs,exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth and the decay of radioactive materials. Logarithmic functions can help rescale large quantities and are particularly helpful for rewriting complicated expressions.

# Derivative of the Exponential Function

Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions. The proofs that these assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.

First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function $B(x)=b^{.0}$ ， $b>0$ , is defined for every real number and is continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined—beginning with the definition of $b^{n}$ ，where $n$ is a positive integer—as the product of $b$ multiplied by itself $n$ times. Later, we defined $b^{0}=1$ ， b⁻ⁿ=1/bⁿ for a positive integer 77 ，and b^(s/t)=(√b)^s for positive integers $s$ and t. These definitions leave open the question of the value of $b^{r}$ where $T$ is an arbitrary real number. By assuming the continuity of $B(x)=b^{x}$ ， $b>0$ we may interpret $b^{r}$ as lim_(x→r)bˣ where the values of $X$ as we take the limit are rational. For example we may view $4^{N}$ as the number satisfying

4³ < 4^π < 4⁴, 4³·¹ < 4^π < 4³·², 4³·¹⁴ < 4^π < 4³·¹⁵, 4³·¹⁴¹ < 4^π < 4³·¹⁴², 4³·¹⁴¹⁵ < 4^π < 4³·¹⁴¹⁶,...

As we see in the following table, 4ˣ ≈ 77.88

Table 3.6 Approximating a Value of. 4π

We also assume that for $B(x)=b^{x}$ $b>0$ ，the value B'(0) of the derivative exists. In this section, we show that by making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function $B(x)$ is differentiable everywhere

We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of $b>0$ for which B'(0)=1 .We define $e$ to be this unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs.Figure 3.33 provides graphs of the functions $y=2^{x}$ $y=3^{x}$ $y=2.7^{x}$ ，and $y=2.8^{x}$ .A visual estimate of the slopes of the tangent lines to these functions at 0 provides evidence that the value of $e$ lies somewhere between 2.7 and 2.8. The function $E(x)=e^{.}$ is called the natural exponential function. Its inverse, L(x) = loge x = ln x is called the natural logarithmic function.

![](./images/ftImrdq8bHx5ULC6GYDrZF1qwdYygpUBO.png)
Figure 3.33 The graph of $E(x)=e^{x}$ is between $y=2^{x}$ and $y=3^{x}$

For a better estimate of $e$ ,we may construct a table of estimates of B'(0) for functions of the form $B(x)=b^{x}$ .Before doing this, recall that

B'(0)=lim_(x→0)(bˣ-b⁰)/(x-0)=lim_(x→0)(bˣ-1)/x≈(bˣ-1)/x

for values of X very close to zero.For our estimates, we choose $x=0.00001$ and $x=-0.00001$ to obtain the estimate

b⁻⁰·⁰⁰⁰⁰¹-1/-0.00001 < B'(0) < (b⁰·⁰⁰⁰⁰¹-1)/0.00001.

See the following table


4|-7
Table 3.7 Estimating a Value of $e$

The evidence from the table suggests that $2.7182<e<2.7183$

The graph of $E(x)=e^{x}$ together with the line $y=x+1$ are shown in Figure 3.34. This line is tangent to the graph of $E(x)=e^{x}$ at $x=0$

![](./images/fNAtEP7DgwvmfeZFhtmUAVggWvtNGSSlf.png)
Figure 3.34 The tangent line to $E(x)=e^{x}$ at $x=0$ has

slope 1.

Now that we have laid out our basic assumptions.we begin our investigation by exploring the derivative of $B(x)=b^{x}$ ， $b>0$ .Recall that we have assumed that B'(0) exists.By applying the limit definition to the derivative we conclude that

B'(0)=lim(h→0)(bʰ-1)/h

Tuming to B'(x) ，we obtain the following

B'(x) = lim_(h→0) (b^(x+h) - b^x)/h = lim_(h→0) (b^x(b^h - 1))/h = b^x lim_(h→0) (b^h - 1)/h = b^x B'(0)

We see that on the basis of the assumption that $B(x)=b^{x}$ is differentiable at 0 $B(x)$ is not only differentiable everywhere, but its derivative is

B'(x) = bˣB'(0)

For $E(x)=e^{X}$ E′(0)=1 .Thus, we have E'(x) = eˣ (The value of B'(0) for an arbitrary function of the form $B(x)=b^{x}$ $b>0$ will be derived later.)

### Theorem 3.14: Derivative of the Natural Exponential Function

Let $E(x)=e^{x}$ be the natural exponential function. Then

$$E^{'}(x)=e^{x}.$$

In general,

d/dx(e^(g(x))) = e^(g(x))g'(x)

### Example 3.74

Derivative of an Exponential Function

Find the derivative of f(x)=e^(tan(2x))

## Solution

f'(x) = e^(tan(2x))d/dx(tan(2x)) = e^(tan(2x))sec²(2x)⋅2

3.50 Find the derivative of $h(x)=xe^{2x}$

## Example 3.76

## Applying the Natural Exponential Function

A colony of mosquitoes has an initial population of 1000. After $t$ days, the population is given by $A(t)=1000e^{0.3t}$ .Show that the ratio of the rate of change of the population, A'(t) ，to the population, $A(t)$ is constant.

### Solution

First find A'(t) .By using the chain rule, we have A'(t)=300e^(0.3t) .Thus, the ratio of the rate of change of the population to the population is given by

A'(t) = (300e^(0.3t))/(1000e^(0.3t)) = 0.3.

The ratio of the rate of change of the population to the population is the constant 0.3.

![](./images/fyMclo8PelNPl5ekZWp5IhShR0GXd7TQx.png)

3.51If $A(t)=1000e^{0.3t}$ describes the mosquito population after $t$ days, as in the preceding example, what is the rate of change of $A(t)$ after 4 days?

## Derivative of the Logarithmic Function

Now that we have the derivative of the natural exponential function, we can use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of its inverse, the natural logarithmic function.

# Theorem 3.15: The Derivative of the Natural Logarithmic Function

If $x>0$ and y = ln x then

dy/dx=1/x

More generally, let $g(x)$ be a differentiable function. For all values of $x$ for which g'(x) > 0 the derivative of

h(x) = ln(g(x)) is givenby

h'(x)=1/g(x)g'(x)

### Proof

If $x>0$ and y = ln x ，then $e^{y}=x.$ Differentiating both sides of this equation results in the equation

eʸdy/dx=1

Solving for dy/dx yields

dy/dx = 1/eʸ

Finally, we substitute $x=e^{y}$ to obtain

dy/dx=1/x

We may also derive this result by applying the inverse function theorem, as follows. Since y=g(x)=ln x is the inverse of $f(x)=e^{X}$ ,，by applying the inverse function theorem we have

dy/dx = 1/f'(g(x)) = 1/e<sup>ln x</sup> = 1/x

Using this result and applying the chain rule to h(x) = ln(g(x)) yields

h'(x) = 1/g(x)g'(x)

口

The raph of y = ln x and its derivative dy/dx=1/x are shown in Figure3.35

![](./images/fYuWAVTQxdQ4gYNG3dT4xPZUAl55F0TRs.png)

Figure 3.35The function y = ln x is increasing on

(0,+∞) . Its derivative y′=1/x is greater than zero on (0,+∞)

### Example 3.77

Taking a Derivative of a Natural Logarithm



dy/dx=b^xln b.

More generally, if $h(x)=b^{g(x)}$ ，then

h'(x)=bᵍ⁽ˣ⁾g'(x)ln b

### Proof

If 
y = logₓ ，then $b^{y}=x$ It follows that ln(bʸ) = ln x Thus y ln b = ln x Solving for $y$ ，we have y=l Differentiating and keeping in mind that ln b is a constant, we see that

dy/dx = 1/(x ln b)

The derivative inEquation 3.33now follows from the chain rule.

If $y=b^{x}$ ，then lny=xlnb .Using implicit differentiation, again keeping in mind that ln b is constant, it follows that (1/y)(dy/dx) = ln b . Solving for dy/dx and substituting $y=b^{x}$ we se thal

dy/dx = y ln b = bˣ ln b

The more general derivative (Equation 3.35) follows from the chain rule.

# Example 3.80

Finding the Slope of a Tangent Line

Find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of y = log₂(3x+1) at $x=1$

###  Solution

To fid the sope, we must evaluate dy/dx at $x=1$ . Using Equation 3.33, we see that

dy/dx=3/((3x+1)ln2)

By evaluating the derivative at $x=1$ ,we see that the tangent line has slope

dy/dx|ₓ=₁ = 3/(4ln2) = 3/ln16

![](./images/fbb323TtCy5G7rZyEPN8ikxKz1lSLpQKc.png)

3.53 Find the slope for the line tangent to $y=3^x$ at $x=2$

### Logarithmic Differentiation

At this point, we can take derivatives of functions of the form $y=(g(x))^{n}$ for certain values of $Tr$ ,as well as functions of the form $y=b^{g(x)}$ where $b>0$ and b≠1 . Unfortunatey, we stilldo not know the derivatives of functions such as $y=x^{x}$ or $y=x^{n}$ . These functions require a technique called logarithmic differentiation, which allows us to differentiate any function of the form $h(x)=g(x)^{f(x)}$ It can also be used to convert a very complex differentiation problem into a simple ne suchas inding he deriaive rt y=(x√(2x+1))/(eˣsin³x). e outinethis echnigu in th folwing roblem-sline strategy.

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Using Logarithmic Differentiation

1. To differentiate $y=h(x)$ using logarithmic differentiation, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation to obtain ln y = ln(h(x)) 2. Use properties of logarithms to expand ln(h(x)) as much as possible. 3. ifferentit oth sides o the eguation On the let wl have (1/y)dy/dx 4. Multiply both sidesof the equation by $y$ to solve for dy/dx 5. Replace $y$ by $h(x)$

# Example 3.81

Using Logarithmic Differentiation

Find the derivative of y = (2x⁴ + 1)^tan x

### Solution

Use logarithmic differentiation to find this derivative

![](./images/fCeSMW3P3cu0ypgaLOOk9W8cUSQtpcIN3.png)

Step 1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides. Step 2. Expand using properties of logarithms. Step 3. Differentiate both sides. Use the product rule on the right Step 4. Multiply by y on both sides
Step 5. Substitute y = (2x⁴+1)^tan x

## Example 3.82

Using Logarithmic Differentiation

Find thederaiv e y=(x√(2x+1))/(eˣsin³x).

### Solution

This problem really makes use of the properties of logarithms and the differentiation rules given in this chapter
ln y = ln(x√(2x+1)/(eˣsin³x))
ln y = ln x + ½ln(2x+1) - x - 3ln(sin x)
(1/y)dy/dx = 1/x + 1/(2x+1) - 1 - 3(cos x)/(sin x)
dy/dx = y(1/x + 1/(2x+1) - 1 - 3cot x)
dy/dx = (x√(2x+1)/(eˣsin³x))(1/x + 1/(2x+1) - 1 - 3cot x)

Step 1.Take the natural logarithm of both sides. Step 2. Expand using properties of logarithms. Step 3. Differentiate both sides Step 4. Multiply by y on both sides
Step 5. Substitute y = (x√(2x+1))/(eˣsin³x)

## Example 3.83

## KEY CONCEPTS

## 3.1 Defining the Derivative

·The slope of the tangent line to a curve measures the instantaneous rate of change of a curve. We can calculate it by

finding the limit of the difference quotient or the difference quotient with increment $h$

·The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a value $d$ is found using either of the definitions for the slope of the tangent line.

Velocity is the rate of change of position. As such, the velocity ν(t) at time $t$ is the derivative of the position $s(t)$ at time $t$ Average velocity is given by

ν_ave = (s(t)-s(a))/(t-a)

Instantaneous velocity is given by.

v(a)=s'(a)=lim_(t→a)(s(t)-s(a))/(t-a)

·We may estimate a derivative by using a table of values

### 3.2 The Derivative as a Function

·The derivative of a function $f(x)$ is the function whose value at $A$ is f'(x)

•The graph of a derivative of a function $f(x)$ is related to the graph of $f(x)$ .Where $f(x)$ has a tangent line with positive slope, f'(x) > 0 .Where $f(x)$ has a tangent line with negative slope, f'(x) < 0 .Where $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent line,. f'(x) = 0

•If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. A function is not differentiable at a point if it is not continuous at the point, if it has a vertical tangent line at the point, or if the graph has a sharp corner or cusp.

·Higher-order derivatives are derivatives of derivatives, from the second derivative to the nth derivative

•The derivative of the sum of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the sum of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$

·The derivative of a constant C multiplied by a function $f$ is the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative •The derivative of the difference of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the difference of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$ •The derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function •The derivative of the quotient of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function minus

the derivative of the second function times the first function,all divided by the square of the second function

•We used the limit definition of the derivative to develop formulas that allow us to find derivatives without resorting to the definition of the derivative. These formulas can be used singly or in combination with each other.

## 3.4 Derivatives as Rates of Change

·Using f(a+h) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)h ,it is possible to estimate $f(a+h)$ given f'(a) and $f(a)$ ·The rate of change of position is yelocity,and the rate of change of yelocitv is acceleration.Speed is the absolute value, or magnitude, of velocity •The population growth rate and the present population can be used to predict the size of a future population •Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit functions can be used to predict, respectively, the cost of producing one more item, the revenue obtained by selling one more item, and the profit obtained by producing and selling one more item.

## 3.5 Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

·We can find the derivatives of sin $X$ and cos $X$ by using the definition of derivative and the limit formulas found earlier. The results are

d/dx(sin x)=cos x d/dx(cos x)=-sin x.

•With these two formulas, we can determine the derivatives of all six basic trigonometric functions

## 3.6 The Chain Rule

•The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for $h(x)=f(g(x))$,

$$h'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x).$$

In Leibniz's notation this rule takes the form

dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx

We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned. and we can derive formulas for some of them

·The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule

If h(x)=(g(x))ⁿ, then h'(x)=n(g(x))ⁿ⁻¹g'(x).

·when appliedtothe composition of three functions.the chain rule can be expressedas follows:If $h(x)=f(g(k(x)))$ then h'(x) = f'(g(k(x))g'(k(x))k'(x)

### 3.7 Derivatives of Inverse Functions

## 3.9 Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

·On the basis of the assumption that the exponential function $y=b^x$ ， $b>0$ is continuous everywhere and

differentiable at O, this function is differentiable everywhere and there is a formula for its derivative

·We can use a formula to find the derivative of y = ln x and the relationship log<sub>b</sub>x = ln x/ln b allows us to extend our differentiation formulas to include logarithms with arbitrary bases

## Introduction.

A rocket is being launched from the ground and cameras are recording the event. A video camera is located on the ground a certain distance from the launch pad. At what rate should the angle of inclination (the angle the camera makes with the

ground) change to allow the camera to record the flight of the rocket as it heads upward? (See Example 4.3.)

A rocket launch involves two related quantities that change over time. Being able to solve this type of problem is just one application of derivatives introduced in this chapter. We also look at how derivatives are used to find maximum and minimum values of functions. As a result, we will be able to solve applied optimization problems, such as maximizing revenue and minimizing surface area. In addition, we examine how derivatives are used to evaluate complicated limits, to approximate roots of functions, and to provide accurate graphs of functions.

# 4.1 | Related Rates

# Learning Objectives.

4.1.1 Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.

4.1.2 Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.

4.1.3Use the chainrule to find therate of change of one quantity that depends on therate of change of other quantities.

We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at which these quantities change are given by derivatives. If two related quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change are related. For example, if a balloon is being filled with air, both the radius of the balloon and the volume of the balloon are increasing. In this section, we consider several problems in which two or more related quantities are changing and we study how to determine the relationship between the rates of change of these quantities.

# Setting up Related-Rates Problems

In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with respect to time. For example, if we consider the balloon example again, we can say that the rate of change in the volume, $V$ is related to the rate of change in the radius, r. In this case, we say that dV/dt and dr/dt are related rates because $V$ is related to $r.$ Here we study everal examples f related quantities that are changing with respect to time and we look at how to calculate one rate of change given another rate of change.

## Example 4.1

## Inflating a Balloon

A spherical balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm³ /sec (Figure 4.2). How fast is the radius increasing when the radius is $3cm$ ？

![](./images/f9XId2TZHg5GsSbd1KtmnqlZmeR4Uovmn.png)
Figure 4.2 As the balloon is being filled with air, both the radius and the volume are increasing with respect to time.

### Solution

The volume of a sphere of radius 7 centimeters is

V=(4/3)πr³ cm³. 

Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the radius are functions of time. Therefore, seconds after beginning to fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is

V(t)=(4/3)π[r(t)]³ cm³.

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of change in the volume is related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation

V'(t) = 4π[r(t)]²r'(t)

The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm³/sec S0 V'(t)=2 cm³/sec .Therefore

2 cm³/sec=(4π[r(t)]² cm²)(r'(t) cm/s)

which implies


r'(t) = 1/(2π[r(t)]²) cm/sec

When the radius $r=3$cm

r'(t) = 1/(18π) cm/sec

![](./images/fU7gia1Oco0ElkvHQ0sAI1PvXgWtisC7w.png)

4.1What is the instantaneous rate of change of the radius when $r=6$cm

Before looking at other examples, let's outline the problem-solving strategy we will be using to solve related-rates problems.

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem

1.Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a figure if applicable 2. State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and the rate to be determined 3. Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1. 4.Using the chain rule, differentiate both sides of the equation found in step 3 with respect to the independent variable. This new equation will relate the derivatives. 5. Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve for the unknown rate of change.

Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute known values too soon. For example, if the value for a changing quantity is substituted into an equation before both sides of the equation are differentiated, then that quantity willbehave as a constant and its derivative will not appear in the new equation found in step 4. We examine this potential error in the following example.

# Examples of the Process

Let's now implement the strategy just described to solve several related-rates problems. The first example involves a plane flying overhead. The relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate at which the distance between the plane and a person on the ground is changing

# Example 4.2

## An Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation

An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. A man is viewing the plane from a position 3000 ft from the base of a radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If the plane is flying at the rate of 600 ft/sec, at what rate is the distance between the man and the plane increasing when the plane passes over the radio tower?

### Solution

Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.

![](./images/fo9LKUUVaHcnIf9Pyuz0VRKh2zLlr6nQG.png)
Figure 4.3 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the

person and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane are changing. We denote those quantities with the variables $s$ and $x$ respectively

As shown, $x$ denotes the distance between the man and the position on the ground directly below the airplane. The variable $s$ denotes the distance between the man and the plane. Note that both $x$ and $s$ are functions of time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. Since an object's height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance between the object and the ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft is perpendicular to the line segment of length $X$ feet, creating a right triangle

Step 2. Since $x$ denotes the horizontal distance between the man and the point on the ground below the plane, dxldt represents the peed of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600ftsec. Therefore, dx/dt=600 ft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane is directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when $x=3000$ ft.

Step 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation relating $X$ and $s$

$$[x(t)]^2+4000^2=[s(t)]^2.$$

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we arrive at the equation

x(dx/dt) = s(ds/dt)

Step 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the plane is increasing when the plane is directly over the radio tower. That is, find ds/dt when $x=3000$ ft. Since the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec,we knov that dx = 600 ft/sec. We are not given an explicit value for $s$ :however, since we are trying to find d wher $x=3000$ ft ,we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance $s$ when $x=3000$ and the heigh is 4000 ft.Solving the equation

$$3000^2+4000^2=s^2$$

for $s$ ，wehave $s=5000$ ft at the time of interest. Using these values, we conclude that ds/dt is a solution o the equation

(3000)(600) = (5000)ds/dt

Therefore,

ds/dt = 3000·600/5000 = 360 ft/sec

Note: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to substitute values for the variables too soon. For example, in step 3, we related the variable quantities $x(t)$ and $s(t)$ by the equation

$$[x(t)]^2+4000^2=[s(t)]^2.$$

Since the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to introduce a variable for the height, and we are allowed to use the constant 4000 to denote that quantity. However, the other two quantities are changing. If we mistakenly substituted $x(t)=3000$ into the equation before differentiating, our equation would have been

$$3000^2+4000^2=[s(t)]^2.$$

After differentiating, our equation would become

0=s(t)ds/dt

As a result, we would incorectlyconclude that ds/dt=0

![](./images/ffNsyVq5dADqeqb1BB7WBwHH6TvHHLSTk.png)

4.2 What is the speed of the plane if the distance between the person and the plane is increasing at the rate of 300 ft/sec?

We now return to the problem involving the rocket launch from the beginning of the chapter.

## Example 4.3

### Chapter Opener:A Rocket Launch

![](./images/fDMgYCgtUKg8FO2iXAtcxKDmx3ERBwscQ.png)
Figure 4.4 (credit: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson,

Wikimedia Commons)

A rocket is launched so that it rises vertically. A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad. When the rocket is 1000 ft above the launch pad, its velocity is 600 ft/sec. Find the necessary rate of change of the camera's angle as a function of time so that it stays focused on the rocket

### Solution

Step 1. Draw a picture introducing the variables.

![](./images/fcagdHfWXoggCK4DPxD3tgkP8olB4mCvo.png)
Figure 4.5 A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad of the rocket. The height of the

rocket and the angle of the camera are changing with respect to time. We denote those quantities with the variables $h$ and θ respectively

Let h denote the height of the rocket above the launch pad and θ be the angle between the camera lens and the

### ground

Step 2. We are trying to find the rate of change in the angle of the camera with respect to time when the rocket is 100ft of the ground. That is, we need to ind dθ/dt  when $h=1000$ fo .At thatime, we know the velocity of the rocket is dh/dt = 600 fi/sec.

Step 3. Now we need to find an equation relating the two quantities that are changing with respect to time: $h$ and θ .How can we create such an equation? Using the fact that we have drawn a right triangle, it is natural to think about trigonometric functions. Recall that tan θ is the ratio of the length of the opposite side of the triangle to the length of the adjacent side.Thus,we have

tanθ=h/5000

This gives us the equatior

h=5000tanθ

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time $t$ we obtair

dh/dt = 5000sec²θ(dθ/dt)

Step 5. We want to find dθ/dt  when $h=1000$ ft. At tis time, we know that dh/dt = 600 fi/sc. We need to determine sec²θ  .Recall that secθ is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side. We know the length of the adjacent side is 5000ft To determine the length of the hypotenuse, we use the Pythagorean theorem, where the length of one leg is 5000 ft ，the length of the other leg is $h=1000$ fr and the length of the hypotenuse is $c$ feet as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fxcTakyXGSewCz3cmmrhrbL6ePHpRBbzt.png)

We see that

$$1000^2+5000^2=c^2$$

and we conclude that the hypotenuse is

c = 1000√26 ft

Therefore, when $h=1000$ wehave

sec²θ=(1000√26/5000)²=26/25

Recallfrom step 4 thathe equation elating dθ/dt  to our known values is

dh/dt = 5000sec²θ(dθ/dt)

When $h=1000$ ft, we know that dh/dt = 600 ft/sed and sec²θ=26/25 Substiting these values into the

previous equation, we arrive at the equation

600 = 5000(26/25)dθ/dt

Therefore, dθ/dt=3/26rad/sec

![](./images/fUMOk3DsPveWsX5u4FlhPdXo8FlRNvNrF.png)

4.3What rate of change is necessary for the elevation angle of the camera if the camera is placed on the ground at a distance of 4000 ft from the launch pad and the velocity of the rocket is 50o ft/sec when the rocket is 2000ft off the ground?

In the next example, we consider water draining from a cone-shaped funnel. We compare the rate at which the level of water in the cone is decreasing with the rate at which the volume of water is decreasing

## Example 4.4

Water Draining from a Funnel

Water is draining from the bottom of a cone-shaped funnel at the rate of 0.03 ft³sec. The height of the funnel is 2 ft and the radius at the top of the funnel is 1 ft. At what rate is the height of the water in the funnel changing when the height o the wateris 1/2ft

### Solution

Step 1: Draw a picture introducing the variables

![](./images/fGfYKcskrYzal4PfdygbzMp17IT1LvrEz.png)
Figure 4.6 Water is draining from a funnel of height 2 ft and

radius 1 ft. The height of the water and the radius of water are changing over time. We denote these quantities with the variables $h$ and $r$ respectively

Let $h$ denote the height of the water in the funnel, $Y$ denote the radius of the water at its surface, and $V$ denote the volume of the water.

Step 2: We need to determine dh/dt when h=1/2: ft. We know that dV/dt=-0.03 ft/sec

Step 3: The volume of water in the cone is

V=(1/3)πr²h

From the figure, we see that we have similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the sides in the two triangles is the same. Therefore, r/h=1/2 or r=h/2 Using this fact, the equation for volume can be simplified to

V = (1/3)π(h/2)²h = (π/12)h³

Step 4: Applying the chain rule while differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time $t$ we obtair

dV/dt = (π/4)h²(dh/dt).

Step 5: We want to find dh/dt when h=1/2ft . Since water is leaving at the rate of 0.03 ft³sec ，we know that dV/dt = -0.03 ft³/ sed . Therefore

-0.03=π/4(1/2)²dh/dt

which implies

-0.03 = (π/16)(dh/dt)

It follows that

dh/dt = -0.48/π = -0.153 ft/sec.

We have just seen how derivatives allow us to compare related quantities that are changing over time. In this section, we examine another application of derivatives: the ability to approximate functions locally by linear functions. Linear functions are the easiest functions with which to work, so they provide a useful tool for approximating function values. In addition, the ideas presented in this section are generalized later in the text when we study how to approximate functions by higher degree polynomials Introduction to Power Series and Functions (http://cnx.org/content/m53760/latest/)

## Linear Approximation of a Function at a Point

Consider a function $f$ that is differentiable at a point $X=d$ .Recall that the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $a$ is given by the equation

$$y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).$$

For example, consider the function f(x) = 1/x at $a=2$ .Since $f$ is differentiable at $x=2$ and f(x) = -, we se that f'(2) = -1/4. Therefore, the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $a=2$ is given by the equation

y=½-¼(x-2)

Figure 4.7(a) shows a graph of f(x) = 1/x along with the tangent line to $f$ at $x=2$ .Note that for X near 2, the graph of the tangent line is close to the graph of $f$ .As a result, we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate $f(x)$ for $X$ near 2. For example, if $x=2.1$ ，the $y$ value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

y=1/2-1/4(2.1-2)=0.475.

The actual value of $f(2.1)$ is given by

f(2.1)=1/2.1≈0.47619

Therefore, the tangent line gives us a fairly good approximation of $f(2.1)$ (Figure 4.7(b). However, note that for values of X far from 2,the equation of the tangent line does not give us a good approximation.For example.if $x=10$ .the -value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

y=1/2-1/4(10-2)=1/2-2=-1.5

whereas the value of the function at $x=10$ is $f(10)=0.1$

![](./images/f7ONgbNThXPcH11VDtNYM0Bxv66ldGqLu.png)
Figure 4.7 (a) The tangent line to $f(x)=1/x$ at $x=2$ provides a good approximation to $f$ for $x$ near 2.

(b) At $x=2.1$ ,，the value of $y$ on the tangent line to $f(x)=1/x$ is 0.475. The actual value of $f(2.1)$ is 1/2.1, which is approximately 0.47619.

In general, for a differentiable function $f$ ，the equation of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=d$ can be used to approximate $f(x)$ for $X$ near $a$ .Therefore,we can write

f(x)≈f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) for x near a.

We call the linear function

$$L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$

the linear approximation, or tangent line approximation, of $f$ at $X=d$ This function $L$ is also known as the linearization of $f$ at X=ω

To show how useful the linear approximation can be, we look at how to find the linear approximation for f(x) = √x at $x=9$

# Example 4.5

Linear Approximation of $VX$

Find the linear approximation of f(x) = √x at $x=9$ and use the approximation to estimate √9.1

### Solution

Since we are looking for the linear approximation at $x=9$ ，using Equation 4.1 we know the linear approximation is given by

$$L(x)=f(9)+f'(9)(x-9).$$

We need to find $f(9)$ and f'(9)

f(x) = √x ⇒ f(9) = √9 = 3; f'(x) = 1/(2√x) ⇒ f'(9) = 1/(2√9) = 1/6

Therefore, the linear approximation is given by Figure 4.8

L(x)=3+(1/6)(x-9)

Using the linear approximation, we can estimate √9.1 by writing

![](./images/fgYv4FyZenDvOevffgGKe9mZffhgRSN0f.png)

Figure 4.8The local linear approximation to f(x) = √x a $x=9$ provides an approximation to $f$ for $X$ near 9

### Analysis

Using a calculator, the value of √9.1 to four decimal places is 3.0166. The value given by the linear approximation, 3.0167, is very close to the value obtained with a calculator, so it appears that using this linear approximation is a good way to estimate √x at least for $X$ near 9. At the same time, it may seem odd to use a linear approximation when we can just push a few buttons on a calculator to evaluate √9.1 .However, how does the calculator evaluate √9.1 ? The calculator uses an approximation! In fact, calculators and computers use approximations all the time to evaluate mathematical expressions; they just use higher-degree approximations

4.5 Find the local linear approximation to f(x) = ³√x at $x=8$ . Use it to approximate ∛8.1 to five decima places.

## Example 4.6

Linear Approximation of sinx

Find the linear approximation of f(x)=sin x at x = π/3 and use it to approximate sin(62°)

## Solution

First we note that since π/3 rad is equivalent to 60° ，using the linear approximation at x=π/3 seems reasonable. The linear approximation is given by

L(x) = f(π/3) + f'(π/3)(x - π/3)

We see that

f(x) = sin x => f(π/3) = sin(π/3) = √3/2
f'(x) = cos x => f'(π/3) = cos(π/3) = 1/2

Therefore, the linear approximation of $f$ at x=π/3 is given by Figure 4.9

L(x) = √3/2 + 1/2(x - π/3)

To estimate sin(62°) using $L$ ,we must first convert 62° to radians. We have 62° = 62π radians, so th estimate for sin(62°) is given by

Figure 4.9The linear approximation to f(x)=sin x at x=π/3 provides an approximation to sin x for $x$ near π/3

![](./images/fnXKntDrG7Cvpx8xy1uYDcDgQzkYgUzlS.png)

4.6 Find the linear approximation for f(x)=cos x at x=π/2

Linear approximations may be used in estimating roots and powers. In the next example, we find the linear approximation for $f(x)=(1+x)^n$ at $x=0$ ,which can be used to estimate roots and powers for real numbers near 1. The same idea can be extended to a function of the form $f(x)=(m+x)^{n}$ to estimate roots and powers near a different number $m$

### Example 4.7

## Approximating Roots and Powers

Find the linear approximation of $f(x)=(1+x)^{n}$ at $x=0$ . Use this approximation to estimate (1.01)3.

### Solution

The linear approximation at $x=0$ is given by

$$L(x)=f(0)+f'(0)(x-0).$$

Because

f(x)=(1+x)^n⇒f(0)=1, f'(x)=n(1+x)^(n-1)⇒f'(0)=n,

the linear approximation is given by Figure 4.10(a).

$$L(x)=1+n(x-0)=1+nx$$

We can approximate $(1.01)^3$ by evaluating $L(0.01)$ when $n=3$ .We conclude that

(1.01)³=f(1.01)≈L(1.01)=1+3(0.01)=1.03

![](./images/foH7gwF10tpg3PB8BDnxUFtUTRPKHkIGb.png)
Figure 4.10 (a) The linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $x=0$ is $L(x)$ . (b) The actual value of $1.01^3$ is

1.030301. The linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $x=0$ estimates $1.01^3$ to be 1.03

4.7Find the linear approximation of $f(x)=(1+x)^{4}$ at $x=0$ without using the result from the preceding example

# Differentials

We have seen that linear approximations can be used to estimate function values. They can also be used to estimate the amount a function value changes as a result of a small change in the input. To discuss this more formally, we define a related concept: differentials. Differentials provide us with a way of estimating the amount a function changes as a result of a smal change in input values

When we first looked at derivatives, we used the Leibniz notation dy/dx to represent the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x.$ Although we used the expressions dy and $dx$ in this notation, they did not have meaning on their own. Here we see a meaning to the expressions dy and dx.Suppose $y=f(x)$ is a differentiable function. Let $dx$ be an independent variable that can be assigned any nonzero real number, and define the dependent variable $dy$ by

$$dy=f'(x)dx.$$

It is important to notice that $dy$ is a function of both λ and $dx$ .The expressions dy and $dx$ are called differentials. We can

divide both sides of Equation 4.2 by $dx$ ，which yields

dy/dx=f'(x).

This is the familiar expression we have used to denote a derivative. Equation 4.2 is known as the differential form of Equation 4.3

# Example 4.8

## Computing differentials

For each of the following functions, find dy and evaluate when $x=3$ and $dx=0.1$

a. y=x²+2x, b. y=cos x

### Solution

The key step is calculating the derivative. When we have that, we can obtain dy directly

$$dy=(2x+2)dx.$$

When $x=3$ and $dx=0.1$

dy=(2⋅3+2)(0.1)=0.8

a.Since $f(x)=x^{2}+2x$ ，we know f'(x) = 2x+2 ，and therefore b. Since f(x) = cos x, f'(x) = -sin(x) .This gives us
dy=-sin x dx
When $x=3$ and $dx=0.1$
dy = -sin(3)(0.1) = -0.1sin(3)

![](./images/fAMoMYwgFnw9hNQt9fKolfdfY4Npmgymz.png)

4.8 For $y=e^{x^2}$ ，find dy

We now connect differentials to linear approximations.Differentials can be used to estimate the change in the value of a function resulting from a small change in input values. Consider a function $f$ that is differentiable at point. $a$ .Suppose the input $X$ changes by a smallamount.We are interested in how much the output y changes.If $X$ changes from $a$ to $a+dx$ ，then the change in $X$ is $dx$ (also denoted Δx )，and the change in $y$ is given by

Δy = f(a+dx) - f(a)

Instead of calculating the exact change in $y$ ,however, it is often easier to approximate the change in $y$ by using a linear approximation. For $JI$ near $a$, $f( x)$ can be approximated by the linear approximation

$$L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).$$

Therefore, if. $dx$ is small,

f(a+dx)≈L(a+dx)=f(a)+f′(a)(a+dx-a).

That is,

f(a + dx) - f(a) ≈ L(a + dx) - f(a) = f'(a)dx

In other words, the actual change in the function $f$ if $X$ increases from $d$ to $a+dx$ is approximately the difference between $L(a+dx)$ and $f(a)$ ，where $L(x)$ is the linear approximation of $f$ at $d$ . By definition of $L(x)$ ， this difference is equal to f'(a)dx . In summary,

Δy=f(a+dx)-f(a)≈L(a+dx)-f(a)=f'(a)dx=dy

Therefore, we can use the differential dy = f'(a)dx  to approximate the change in $y$ if $X$ increases from X=ℚ to $x=a+dx$ .We can see this in the following graph

![](./images/fnKDiG7G8FKD0oxNgdWMa4BAsUpV9s32F.png)
Figure 4.11 The differential dy = f'(a)dx  is used to approximate the actual

change in $y$ if $x$ increases from $a$ to $a+dx$

We now take a look at how to use differentials to approximate the change in the value of the function that results from a small change in the value of the input. Note the calculation with differentials is much simpler than calculating actual values of functions and the result is very close to what we would obtain with the more exact calculation.

## Example 4.9

Approximating Change with Differentials

Let $y=x^{2}+2x$ .Compute△y and dy at $x=3$ if $dx=0.1$

### Solution

The actual change in $y$ if X changes from $x=3$ to $x=3.1$ is given by

Δy=f(3.1)-f(3)=[(3.1)²+2(3.1)]-[3²+2(3)]=0.81

The approximate change in $y$ is given by dy=f'(3)dx .Since f'(x) = 2x+2 ，we have

$$dy=f'(3)dx=(2(3)+2)(0.1)=0.8.$$

4.9For $y=x^{2}+2x$, find △y and dy at $x=3$ if $dx=0.2$

# Calculating the Amount of Error

Any type of measurement is prone to a certain amount of error. In many applications, certain quantities are calculated based on measurements. For example, the area of a circle is calculated by measuring the radius of the circle. An error in the measurement of the radius leads to an error in the computed value of the area. Here we examine this type of error and study how differentials can be used to estimate the error

Consider a function $f$ with an input that is a measured quantity. Suppose the exact value of the measured quantity is $a$ but the measured value is $a+dx.$ We say the measurement error is $dx$ (or Δx ).As a result, an error occurs in the calculated quantity $f(x)$ . This type of error is known as a propagated error and is given by

Δy = f(a+dx) - f(a)

Since all measurements are prone to some degree of error, we do not know the exact value of a measured quantity, so we cannot calculate the propagated error exactly. However, given an estimate of the accuracy of a measurement, we can use differentials to approximate the propagated error y. Specifically, if $f$ is a differentiable function at $a$ ，the propagated error is

Δy≈dy=f′(a)dx

Unfortunately, we do not know the exact value $d$ .However,we can use the measured value $a+dx$ and estimate

Δy ≈ dy ≈ f'(a+dx)dx

In the next example, we look at how differentials can be used to estimate the error in calculating the volume of a box if we assume the measurement of the side length is made with a certain amount of accuracy

## Example 4.10

## Volume of a Cube

Suppose the side length of a cube is measured to be $5cm$ with an accuracy of 0.1 cm

a.Use differentials to estimate the error in the computed volume of the cube.

b.Compute the volume of the cube if the side length is (i) $4.9cm$ and (i) 5.1 cm to compare the estimatec error with the actual potential error

## Solution

a.The measurement of the side length is accurate to within ±0.1 cm . Therefore,

-0.1 ≤ dx ≤ 0.1

The volume of a cube is given by $V=x^{3}$ ，which leads to

$$dV=3x^{2}dx.$$

Using the measured side length of $5cm$ , we can estimate that


-3(5)²(0.1) ≤ dV ≤ 3(5)²(0.1).

Therefore,

-7.5≤dV≤7.5.

b.If the side length is actually $4.9cm$ , then the volume of the cube is

V(4.9) = (4.9)³ = 117.649 cm³

If the side length is actually 5.1 cm. then the volume of the cube is

V(5.1) = (5.1)³ = 132.651 cm³

Therefore, the actual volume of the cube is between 117.649 and 132.651. Since the side length is measured to be $5cm$ , the computed volume is $V(5)=5^{3}=125$ . Therefore, the error in the computec volume is

117.649-125≤ΔV≤132.651-125

That is,

-7.351≤ΔV≤7.651

We see the estimatederror $dV$ is relatively close to the actual potential error in the computed volume

![](./images/fELQBP6Py1rmVGG3tYmhLV1PQW8U1f6gF.png)

4.10Estimate the error in the computed volume of a cube if the side length is measured to be 6cm with an accuracy of 0.2cm

The measurement error dx (=Δx' ) and the propagated error Δy are absolute errors. We are typically interested in the size of an error relative to the size of the quantity being measured or calculated. Given an absolute error Δq for aparticular quantity, we define the relative error as 
Δq/q where $q$ is the actual value of the quantity. The percentage eror is the relative error expressed as a percentage. For example, if we measure the height of a ladder to be 63 in. when the actual height is 62 in , the absolute eroris in but the relative eroris 1/62 = 0.016 ，or 1.6% . By comparison, if we measure the widthofa pieef carardtobe5in when the acual widthisin or ablte s 1/4 in, whereas the relative eror is 0.25/8=1/32 ，or 3.1% . Therefore, the percentagero in the measuremen of the crdbhard islarge, even though 0.25 in. is less than 1 in.

### Example 4.11

## Relative and Percentage Error

An astronaut using a camera measures the radius of Earth as 40000 mi with an error of ±80 mi .Let's use differentials to estimate the relative and percentage error of using this radius measurement to calculate the volume of Earth, assuming the planet is a perfect sphere

### Solution

If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80 ，we have

-80≤dr≤80.

Since the olume of a sphereisgivenby V = (4/3)πr³ ，we have

dV = 4πr²dr

Using the measured radius of 40000 mi , we can estimate

-4π(4000)²(80) ≤ dV ≤ 4π(4000)²(80)

To estimate the relative error, consider dV/V Since we do not know the exact value of the volume $V$ ，use the measured radius $r=4000$mi to estimate $V$ . We obtain V ~ (4(4000)3. Therefore the relative error satisfie.

-4π(4000)²(80)/(4π(4000)³/3) ≤ dV/V ≤ 4π(4000)²(80)/(4π(4000)³/3)

which simplifies to

-0.06≤dV/V≤0.06

The relative error is 0.06 and the percentage error is 6%

 4.1 Determine the percentage erorif the raduso Earthis measured to be 3950 mi with an eror of ±100 mi.

4.3.3Explainhow to find the criticalpoints ofa function over a closed interval. 4.3.4 Describe how to use critical points to locate absolute extrema over a closed interval

Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the largest and smallest values of the function. This information is important in creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function also has practical significance because we can use this method to solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit, minimizing the amount of material used in manufacturing an aluminum can, or finding the maximum height a rocket can reach. In this section, we look at how to use derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function

# Absolute Extrema

Consider the function $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ over the interval (-∞, ∞) .As x→±∞, f(x)→∞ . Therefore, the function does not have a largest value. However, since x² + 1 ≥ 1 for all real numbers $x$ and $x^{2}+1=1$ when $x=0$ ，the function has a smallest value, 1, when $x=0$ .We say that 1 is the absolute minimum of $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ and it occurs at $x=0$ .We say that $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure)

![](./images/fqH4qcZWCBH8DG4Z3dQG91VaCAwhOIYvy.png)

Fiqure 4.12 The given function has an absolute minimum of 1 at $x=0$ .The function does not have an absolute maximum

### Definition

Let $f$ be a function defined over an interval $I$ and let c∈I .We say $f$ has an absolute maximum on $I$ at $C$ if f(c) ≥ f(x) for all x∈I We say $f$ has an absolute minimum on $I$ at $c$ if f(c)≤f(x) for all x ∈ I If $f$ has an absolute maximum on $I$ at $C$ or an absolute minimum on $I$ at $C$ ，we say $f$ has an absolute extremum on $I$ at C.

Before proceeding, let's note two important issues regarding this definition. First, the term absolute here does not refer to absolute value. An absolute extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function $f$ has an absolute extremum over an interval $I$ at $C$ the absolute extremum is $f(c)$ .The real number $C$ is a point in the domain at which the absolute extremum occurs. For example, consider the function $f(x)=1/(x^{2}+1)$ over the interval (-∞), ∞ .Since

f(0)=1≥1/(x²+1)=f(x)

for all real numbers $x$ wesay $f$ has an absolute maximum over (-∞), ∞ at $X=0$ . The absolute maximum is

### $f(0)=1$ .It occurs at $X=0$ as shown in Figure 4.13(b)

A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, just one extremum, or neither. Figure 4.13 shows several functions and some of the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema. However, the following theorem, called the Extreme Value Theorem,guarantees that a continuous function $f$ over a closed, bounded interval  [a,b] has

both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum

![](./images/fZqoU73HeTmGxX43hgkSC6ZsnFzCBdQwM.png)
Fiqure 4.13 Graphs (a). (b), and (c) show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a domain o

(-∞), ∞ . Graphs (d), (e), and (f) show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a domain that is a

bounded interval.

### Theorem 4.1:Extreme Value Theoren

If $f$ is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ ，then there is a point in [a, b] at which $f$ has an absolute maximum over $[a,b]$ and there is a point in $[a,b]$ at which $f$ has an absolute minimum over [a, b]

The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the

function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval $I$ is open or the function has even one point of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over $I$ For example, consider the functions shown in Figure 4.13(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [O, 4], the function is discontinuous at $x=2$ . The function has an absolute maximum over [O, 4] but does not have an absolute minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [O, 2), but is not defined at $x=2$ ，and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [O, 2), but does not have an absolute maximum over [O, 2). These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum

Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let's examine the related concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in determining where absolute extrema occur.

## Local Extrema and Critical Points

Consider the function $f$ shown in Figure 4.14. The graph can be described as two mountains with a valley in the middle. The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at $x=2$ .However, $x=0$ is also a point of interest. Although $f(0)$ is not the largest value of $f$ ，the value $f(0)$ is larger than $f(x)$ for all $X$ near 0. We say $f$ has a local maximum at $x=0$ Similarly, the function $f$ does not have an absolute minimum, but it does have a local minimum at $x=1$ because $f(1)$ is less than $f(x)$ for $x$ near 1

![](./images/faDl8QRZtxkliF2Gatnzf7GXx2wZYTx1p.png)
Figure 4.14 This function $f$ has two local maxima and one

local minimum. The local maximum at $x=2$ is also the absolute maximum.

### Definition

A function $f$ has a local maximum at $C$ if there exists an open interval $I$ containing $C$ such that $I$ is contained in the domain of. $f$ and f(c) ≥ f(x) for all x∈I A function $f$ has a local minimum at $C$ if there exists an open interval $I$ containing C such that $I$ is contained in the domain of $f$ and f(c)≤f(x) for all x∈I A function $f$ has a local extremum at $C$ if $f$ has a local maximum at $C$ or $f$ has a local minimum at $C$

Note that if $f$ has an absolute extremum at $C$ and $f$ is defined over an interval containing $C$ ，then $f(c)$ is also considered a local extremum. If an absolute extremum for a function $f$ occurs at an endpoint, we do not consider that to be

a local extremum, but instead refer to that as an endpoint extremum.

Given the graph of a function $f$ it is sometimes easy to see where a local maximum or local minimum occurs. However, it is not always easy to see, since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible because they occur at a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function to determine where these extrema occur?

To answer this question, let's look at Figure 4.14 again. The local extrema occur at $x= 0$, $x= 1$ ,and $x=2$ .Notice that at $x=0$ and $x=1$ ，the derivative f'(x) = 0 .At $x=2$ ，the derivative f'(x) does not exist, since the function $f$ has a corner there. In fact, if $f$ has a local extremum at a point $x=c$ the derivative f'(c) must satisfy one of the following conditions: either f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined. Such a value $C$ is known as a critical point and it is important in finding extreme values for functions.

### Definition

Let $c$ be an interior point in the domain of $f$ We say that $C$ is a critical point of $f$ if f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined.

As mentioned earlier, if $f$ has a local extremum at a point $X=C$ ，then $c$ must be a critical point of $f$ . This fact is known as Fermat's theorem

## Theorem 4.2: Fermat's Theorem

If $f$ has a local extremum at $C$ and $f$ is differentiable at C ，then f'(c)=0

## Proof

Suppose $f$ has a local extremum at $c$ and $f$ is differentiable at $C$ .We need to show that f'(c)=0 .To do this, we will show that f'(c) ≥ 0 and f'(c)≤0 ，and therefore f'(c)=0 .Since $f$ has a local extremum at $c$, $f$ f $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at $C$ .Suppose $f$ has a local maximum at $C$ The case in which $f$ has a local minimum at $C$ can be handled similarly. There then exists an open interval $I$ such that f(c) ≥ f(x) for all x∈I .Since $f$ is differentiable at L from the definition of the derivative,we know that

f'(c)=lim_(x→c)(f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)

Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f'(c) . Therefore,

f'(c)=limₓ→c⁺(f(x)-f(c))/(x-c),

and

f'(c)=lim_(x→c⁻)(f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)

Since $f(c)$ is a local maximum, we see that f(x) - f(c) ≤ 0 for $X$ near $C$ .Therefore, for $X$ near $C$ ，but $X>C$ we have (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)≤0 . From Equation 4.4 we conclude that f'(c)≤0 .Similarly, it can be shown that f'(c) ≥ 0 Therefore, f'(c)=0

口

From Fermat's theorem, we conclude that if $f$ has a local extremum at $C$ ，then either f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined. In other words, local extrema can only occur at critical points

Note this theorem does not claim that a function $f$ must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that critical points are candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function $f(x)=x^{3}$ .We have f'(x) = 3x² = 0 when $x=0$ . Therefore, $x=0$ is a critical point. However, $f(x)=x^{3}$ is increasing over (-∞), ∞ ，and thus $f$ does not have a local extremum at $x=0$ .In Figure 4.15,we see several different possibilities for critical points.In some of these cases, the functions have local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not. Note that these graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a function at a critical point.

(d) (e)

Figure 4.15 (ae) A function $f$ has a critical point at $c$ if f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined. A function may or may not have a local extremum at a critical point.

Later in this chapter we look at analytical methods for determining whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. For now, let's turn our attention to finding critical points. We will use graphical observations to determine whether a critical point is associated with a local extremum

## Example 4.12

### Locating Critical Points

For each of the following functions, find all critical points. Use a graphing utility to determine whether the function has a local extremum at each of the critical points

a. f(x) = (1/3)x³ - (5/2)x² + 4x  b. f(x) = (x² - 1)³  c. f(x) = 4x/(1 + x²) 

## Solution

a. The derivative f'(x)=x²-5x+4 is defined for all real numbers $X$ Therefore, we only need to find the values for $X$ where f'(x) = 0 Since f'（x)=x²-5x + 4 =（x -4）（x -1),the critical points are $x=1$ and $x=4$ .From the graph of $f$ in Figure 4.16, we see that $f$ has a local maximum at $x=1$ and a local minimum at $x=4$

![](./images/fDnnHkxAKFUyPkQBhHvIQTo3btLGevd2q.png)
Fiaure 4.16This function has a local maximum and a loca

minimum.

b.Using the chain rule,we see the derivative is

f'(x)=3(x²-1)²(2x)=6x(x²-1)²

Therefore, $f$ has critical points when $x=0$ and when $x^{2}-1=0$ We conclude that the critical points are x = 0, ±1 ±1士1 From the graph of $f$ in Figure 4.17, we see that $f$ has a local (and absolute) minimum at $x=0$ ,but does not have a local extremum at $x=1$ or $x=-1$

![](./images/fggLy6b1LogSRhfgucBUgfvRMRmUVyVqI.png)

Figure 4.17This function has three critical points: $x=0$ $x=1$ ，and $x=-1$ .The function has a local (and absolute) minimum at $x=0$ but does not have extrema at the other two critical points.

C.By the chain rule, we see that the derivative is

f'(x) = (1+4x² - 8x²)/(1+x²)² = (4-4x²)/(1+x²)²

The derivative is defined everywhere.Therefore,we only need to find values for λI where f'(x) = 0 Solving f'(x) = 0 ，we see that $4-4x^{2}=0$ ，which implies x=±1 .Therefore, the critical points are x=±1 .From the graph of $f$ in Figure 4.18, we see that $f$ has an absolute maximum at $x=1$

and an absolute minimum at $x=-1$ .Hence, $f$ has a local maximum at $x=1$ and a local minimum a $x=-1$ .(Note that if $f$ has an absolute extremum over an interval $I$ at a point C that is not an endpoin of $I$ then $f$ has a local extremum at $C$ ）

# Locating Absolute Extrema

The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. As shown in Figure 4.13, one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an endpoint. If an absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however, it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute extremum is a local extremum. Therefore, by Fermat’s Theorem, the point $c$ at which the local extremum occurs must be a critical point. We summarize this result in the following theorem

### Theorem 4.3:Location of Absolute Extrema

Let $f$ be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The absolute maximum of $f$ over $I$ and the absolute minimum of $f$ over $I$ must occur at endpoints of $I$ or at critical points of $f$ in $I$

With this idea in mind, let's examine a procedure for locating absolute extrema.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed Interval

 Consider a continuous function $f$ defined over the closed interval [a, b].

1.Evaluate $f$ at the endpoints $x=a$ and $x=b$ 2. Find all critical points of $f$ that lie over the interval $(a,b)$ and evaluate $f$ at those critical points 3. Compare all values found in (1) and (2). From Location of Absolute Extrema, the absolute extrema must occur at endpoints or critical points. Therefore, the largest of these values is the absolute maximum of $f$ .The smallest of these values is the absolute minimum of $f$

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values for continuous functions,

### Example 4.13

### Locating Absolute Extrema

For each of the following functions, find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum over the specified interval and state where those values occur.

a. $f(x)=-x^{2}+3x-2$ over [1, 3]. b. $f(x)=x^{2}-3x^{2/3}$ over [0., 2].

### Solution

a.Step 1. Evaluate $f$ at the endpoints $x=1$ and $x=3$

f(1)=0 and f(3)=-2

Step 2. Since f'(x)=-2x+3 f' is defined for all real numbers $x$ Therefore, there are no critical points where the derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f'(x) = 0 .Since f′(x)=-2x+3=0 at x=3/2 and 3/2 is in the interval [1, 3], 
f(3/2) is a candidate for an absolute extremum of $f$ over [1, 3]. We evaluate f} and find

f(3/2)=1/4.

Step 3. We set up the following table to compare the values found in steps 1 and 2.

$x|$f(x)|Conclusion<br>
0|0|<br>
3/2|1/4|Absolute maximum<br>
3|-2|Absolute minimum<br>


From the table, we find that the absolute maximum of $f$ over the interval [1, 3] is 1/4 and it occurs at x=3/2 The absolute minimum of $f$ over the interval [1, 3] is -2 , and it ocurs at $x=3$ as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/fnlx6br1X5KIoSavp0B8XfnyoBEE14utQ.png)
Figure 4.19This function has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.

b.Step 1. Evaluate $f$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=2$

f(0)=0 and f(2)=4-3∛4≈-0.762

Step 2. The derivative of $f$ is given by

f'(x)=2x-2/x¹/³=(2x⁴/³-2)/x¹/³

for x ≠ 0 .The derivative is zero when $2x^{4/3}-2=0$ ,which implies x=±1 .The derivative is undefined at $x=0$ .Therefore, the critical points of $f$ are x =0 $x=0$ $x= 0$, 1,-1 -1 -1 .The point $x=0$ is an endpoint, so we already evaluated $f(0)$ in step 1. The point $x=-1$ is not in the interval of interest, so we need only evaluate $f(1)$ .We find that

$$f(1)=-2.$$

Step 3. We compare the values found in steps 1 and 2, in the following table.


$x|$f(x)|Conclusion<br>
0|0|Absolute maximum<br>
1|-2|Absolute minimum<br>
7|-0.762|<br>


We conclude that the absolute maximum of $f$ over the interval [0, 2] is zero, and it occurs at $x=0$ .The absolute minimum is -2 , and it occurs at $x=1$ as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/f5mOY8LBAddpplMVlnpzqePZWp2BGacWZ.png)
Fiaure 4.20This function has an absolute maximum at an

endpoint of the interval.

4.13 Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of $f(x)=x^{2}-4x+3$ over the interval [1, 4]

At this point, we know how to locate absolute extrema for continuous functions over closed intervals. We have also defined local extrema and determined that if a function $f$ has a local extremum at a point $C$ ，then $C$ must be a critical point of $f$ However, $C$ being a critical point is not a sufficient condition for $f$ to have a local extremum at $C$ Later in this chapter we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. First, however, we need to introduce the Mean Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of a function.

# 4.4 | The Mean Value Theorem

# Learning Objectives.

4.4.1 Explain the meaning of Rolle's theorem.

4.4.2 Describe the significance of the Mean Value Theorem

4.4.3 State three important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem

The Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important theorems in calculus. We look at some of its implications at the end of this section. First, let's start with a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, called Rolle’s theorem.

# Rolle's Theorem

Informally, Rolle’s theorem states that if the outputs of a differentiable function $f$ are equal at the endpoints of an interval, then there must be an interior point $C$ where f'(c)=0 Figure 4.21 illustrates this theorem

![](./images/fCQ3YWmBHcEZXNkETNi3p9qy4a0F4Qgsl.png)
Figure 4.21 If a differentiable function $f$ satisfies $f(a)=f(b)$ ,then its derivative must be zero at some point(s)

between $a$ and $b$

## Theorem 4.4: Rolle's Theorem

Let $f$ be a continuous function over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval (a, b) such that $f(a)=f(b)$ . There then exists at least one 
c∈(a,b) such that f'(c)=0

### Proof

Let $k=f(a)=f(b)$ .We consider three cases:

1. $f(x)=k$ for all x∈(a,b) 2. There exists x∈(a,b) such that $f(x)>k$ 3.There exists x∈(a,b) such that $f(x)<k$ Case 1: If $f(x)=k$ for all x∈(a,b) ，then f(x) = 0 for all x∈(a,b)

Case 2: Since $f$ is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ ，by the extreme value theorem, it has an absolute maximum. Also, since there is a point x∈(a,b) such that $f(x)>k$ the absolute maximum is greater than $k$ Therefore, the absolute maximum does not occur at either endpoint. As a result, the absolute maximum must occur at an interior point 
c∈(a,b) . Because $f$ has a maximum at an interior point $C$ ,and $f$ is differentiable at $C$ ，by Fermat's theorem, f'(c)=0

Case 3: The case when there exists a point x∈(a,b) such that $f(x)<k$ is analogous to case 2, with maximum replaced by minimum

口

An important point about Rolle’s theorem is that the differentiability of the function $f$ is critical. If $f$ is not differentiable, even at a single point, the result may not hold. For example, the function $f(x)=|x|-1$ is continuous over [-1,1] and $f(-1)=0=f(1)$, but f'(c) ≠ 0 for any c ∈ (-1, 1) as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fWNqgs1ovcSkvn0mhMkcPyMAOMqrTzVmg.png)
No c such that f'(c)=0

Figure 4.22 Since $f(x)=|x|-1$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ ,the conditions of Rolle’s theorem are not satisfied. Ir fact, the conclusion does not hold here; there is no c ∈ (-1, 1) such that f'(c)=0

Let's now consider functions that satisfy the conditions of Rolle's theorem and calculate explicitly the points $C$ where f'(c)=0

## Example 4.14

## Using Rolle's Theorem

For each of the following functions, verify that the function satisfies the criteria stated in Rolle's theorem and find all values $C$ in the given interval where f'(c)=0

a. $f(x)=x^{2}+2x$ over [2, 0] b. $f(x)=x^{3}-4x$ over [2, 2]

### Solution

a.Since $f$ is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere. In addition, $f(-2)=0=f(0)$ Therefore, $f$ satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. We conclude that there exists at least one value weseethat c∈(-2,0) suchthat f'(c)=0 Since f′(x)=2x+2=2(x+1) f'(c)=2(c+1)=0 implies $c=-1$ as shown in the following graph

![](./images/fCLOyQmLfxTQD4WPyNOaM05Pgn1Q4fsOA.png)
Figure 4.23 This function is continuous and differentiable

over [-2,0] ， f'(c)=0 when $c=-1$

b. As in part a. $f$ is a polynomial and therefore is continuous and differentiable everywhere. Also, $f(-2)=0=f(2)$ .That said, $f$ satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Differentiating, we find that f'(x) = 3x² - 4 .Therefore, f'(c)=0 when x = ±2/√3 Both points are in the interval [2, 2], and therefore,both points satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's theorem as shown in the following graph

at x=±2/√3

4.14 Verify that the function $f(x)=2x^{2}-8x+6$ defined over the interval [1, 3] satisfies the conditions of Rolle’s theorem. Find all points $C$ guaranteed by Rolle's theorem

# The Mean Value Theorem and Its Meaning

Rolle's theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. In Rolle's theorem, we consider differentiable functions $f$ defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ b $b1$ with $f( a) = f( b)$ . The Mean Value Theorem generalizes Rolle's theorem by considering functions that do not necessarily have equal value at the endpoints. Consequently, we can view the Mean Value Theorem as a slanted version of Rolle's theorem (Figure 4.25). The Mean Value Theorem states that if $f$ is continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ ，then there exists a point 
c∈(a,b) such that the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $C$ is parallel to the secant line connecting (a, $f(a))$ and $( b$, $f( b) ) .$

![](./images/fR0Paz7fXHMcqSx66iEy7Lyp4X4UBblWC.png)

Fiqure 4.25The Mean Value Theorem says that for a function that meets its conditions, at some point the tangent line has the same slope as the secant line between the ends. For this function, there are two values $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that the tangent line to $f$ at $c_1$ and $c_2$ has the same slope as the secant line.

### Theorem 4.5:Mean Value Theorem

Let $f$ be continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ .Then, there exists at least one point 
c∈(a,b) such that

f'(c) = (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

### Proof

The proof follows from Rolle's theorem by introducing an appropriate function that satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Consider the line connecting $( a$, $f( a) )$ and $( b$, $f( b)$ 1.Since the slope of that line is

(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

and the line passes through the point $( a$, $f( a) )$ ,the equation of that line can be written as

y=(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)(x-a)+f(a).

Let $g(x)$ denote the vertical difference between the point $( x$, $f( x) )$ and the point $(x,y)$ on that line. Therefore

g(x) = f(x) - [(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)(x-a) + f(a)]

![](./images/fqKhp8Vk1hgRUaeI90zyGaktqUXxDmeIt.png)

Figure 4.26 The value $g(x)$ is the vertical difference between the point $( x$, $f( x) )$ and the point $(x,y)$ on the secant line connecting $( a$, $f( a) )$ and $( b$, $f( b) )$

Since the graph of $f$ intersects the secant line when $x=a$ and $x=b$ ，we see that $g(a)=0=g(b)$ .Since $f$ is a differentiable function over $( a, b)$, $g$ g $g$ is also a differentiable function over (a, $b$ ). Furthermore, since $f$ is continuous over $[ a, b]$, $g$ is also continuous over $[a,b]$ . Therefore, $g$ satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Consequently, there exists a point 
c∈(a,b) such that g'(c)=0 .Since

g'(x)=f'(x)-(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

we see that

g'(c) = f'(c) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)

Since g'(c)=0 we conclude that

f'(c) = (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

口

In the next example, we show how the Mean Value Theorem can be applied to the function f(x)=√x over the interval [0, 9]. The method is the same for other functions, although sometimes with more interesting consequences.

## Example 4.15

### Verifying that the Mean Value Theorem Applies

For f(x) = √x over the interval [0, 9], show that $f$ satisfies the hypothesis of the Mean Value Theorem, and therefore there exists at least one value c ∈ (0, 9) such that f'(c) is equal to the slope of the line connecting (0, f(0)⟩ and (9, $f(9)$ 1. Find these values $C$ guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem

### Solution

We know that f(x) = √x is continuous over [O, 9] and differentiable over (O, 9). Therefore, $f$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem, and there must exist at least one value c ∈ (0, 9) such that f'(c) is equal to the slope of the line connecting (0, $f( 0) )$ and (9, $f( 9) )$ (Figure 4.27). To determine which value(s)

of $C$ are gane rs cale he eraie re $f$ The dervaive f'(x) = 1/(2√x) Th slope o hlie connecting (0, $f( 0) )$ and (9, $f( 9) )$ is given by

(f(9)-f(0))/(9-0)=(√9-√0)/9=1/3

We want to find $L$ such that f'(c)=1/3 That is, we want to find $L$ such that

1/(2√c)=1/3.

Solving this equation for $C$ ,we obtain c = . At this point, the slope of the tangent line equals the slope of the line joining the endpoints.

![](./images/fdApMkcpk1pUgbaYPg2sGQGFHqHy7KNey.png)
Figure 4.27 The slope of the tangent line at $c=9/4$ is the same as the slope of the line segment

connecting (0, 0) and (9, 3).

One application that helps illustrate the Mean Value Theorem involves velocity. For example, suppose we drive a car for $1h$ down a straight road with an average velocity of 45 mph. Let $s(t)$ and ν(t) denote the position and velocity of the car, respectively, for 
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 h. Assuming that the position function $s(t)$ is differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem to conclude that, at some time c ∈ (0,1) ,the speed of the car was exactly

ν(c)=s′(c)=(s(1)-s(0))/(1-0)=45 mph

## Example 4.16

##  Mean Value Theorem and Velocity

If a rock is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its position $t$ seconds after it is dropped until it hits the ground is

given by the function $s(t)=-16t^{2}+100$

a.Determine how long it takes before the rock hits the ground b.Find the average velocity ν<sub>avg</sub> of the rock for when the rock is released and the rock hits the ground. C.Find the time $t$ guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem when the instantaneous velocity of the rockis ν<sub>avg</sub>

### Solution

a.When the rock hits the ground, its position is $s(t)=0$ .Solving the equation $-16t^{2}+100=0$ for $t$ we find that t=±5/2sec . Since we are only considering t≥0 ，the ball will hit the ground sec afte it is dropped

b.The average velocity is given by

ν<sub>avg</sub>=(s(5/2)-s(0))/(5/2-0)=(0-100)/(5/2)=-40 ft/sec

C.The instantaneous velocity is given by the derivative of the position function. Therefore, we need to find a time $t$ such that ν(t) = s'(t) = ν_avg = -40 ft/sec. Since $s(t)$ is continuous over the interval [0, 5/2] and differentiable over the interval (O, 5/2), by the Mean Value Theorem, there is guaranteed to be a point c ∈ (0, 5/2) such that

s'(c)=(s(5/2)-s(0))/(5/2-0)=-40

Taking the derivative of the position function $s(t)$ ，we find that s′(t)=-32t Therefore, the equatior reduces to s′(c)=-32c=-40 . Solving this equation for $C$ we have c=5/4. Therefore, 5/4 sec afte the rock is dropped, the instantaneous velocity equals the average velocity of the rock during its free fall -40 ft/sec.

![](./images/fyIx9sssL7osw7mKXAsEPQkzVdLtydGWr.png)
Figure 4.28 At time $t=5/4$ sec, the velocity of the rock is

equal to its average velocity from the time it is dropped until it hits the ground.

4.15 Suppose a ballis dropped from a height of 200 ft. Its position at time $t$ is $s(t)=-16t^{2}+200$ Find the time $t$ when the instantaneous velocity of the ball equals its average velocity

# Corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem

Let's now look at three corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem. These results have important consequences, which we use in upcoming sections.

At this point, we know the derivative of any constant function is zero. The Mean Value Theorem allows us to conclude that the converse is also true. In particular, if f'(x) = 0 for all $x$ in some interval $I$ ，then $f(x)$ is constant over that interval. This result may seem intuitively obvious, but it has important implications that are not obvious, and we discuss them shortly.

### Theorem 4.6: Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zerc

Let $f$ be differentiable over an interval $I$ If f'(x)=0 for all x∈I then $f(x)=$ constant for all x∈I

## Proof

Since $f$ is differentiable over $I$, $f$ f $f$ must be continuous over $I$ .Suppose $f(x)$ is not constant for all $X$ in $I$ .Then there exist $d$ ， b ∈ I where a≠b and f(a)≠f(b) .Choose the notation so that $a<b$ .Therefore,

(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)≠0

Since $f$ is a differentiable function, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists 
c∈(a,b) such that

f'(c) = (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

Therefore, there exists c∈I such that f'(c) ≠ 0 ,，which contradicts the assumption that f'(x) = 0 for all x∈I

口From Corollary 1:Functions with a Derivative of Zero,it follows that if two functions have the same derivative, they differ by, at most, a constant.

### Theorem 4.7:Corollary 2:Constant Difference Theorem

If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable over an interval $I$ and f'(x) = g'(x) for all x∈I ，then $f(x)=g(x)+C$ for some constant $C$

## Proof

Let $h(x)=f(x)-g(x)$ .Then, h'(x)=f'(x)-g'(x)=0 for all x∈I . By Corollary 1, there is a constant $C$ such that $h(x)=C$ for all x∈I .Therefore, $f(x)=g(x)+C$ for all x∈I

口The third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing. Recall that a function $f$ is increasing over $I$ if $f(x_{1})<f(x_{2})$ whenever $x_{1}<x_{2}$ whereas $f$ is decreasing over $I$ if $f(x)_{1}>f(x_{2})$ whenever $x_{1}<x_{2}$ . Using the Mean Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is positive, then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing (Figure 4.29). We make use of this fact in the next section. where we show how to use the derivative of a function to locate local maximum and minimum values of the function, and how to determine the shape of the graph.

This fact is important because it means that for a given function $f$ ,if there exists a function $F$ such that F'(x)=f(x) then, the only other functions that have a derivative equal to $f$ are $F(x)+C$ for some constant $C$ We discuss this result in more detail later in the chapter

fis increasing fis decreasing fis increasing

Figure 4.29 If a function has a positive derivative over some interval $I$ then the function increases over that interval $I$ ; if the derivative is negative over some interval $I$ ，then the function decreases over that interval $I$

## Theorem 4.8: Corollary 3: Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Let $f$ be continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$

i.If f'(x)>0 for all x∈(a,b) ，then $f$ is an increasing function over [a, b] ii. If f'(x) < 0 for all x∈(a,b) ，then $f$ is a decreasing function over $[a,b]$

### Proof

We will prove i.; the proof of i. is similar. Suppose $f$ is not an increasing function on $I$ Then there exist $a$ and $b$ in $I$ such that $a<b$ ，but f(a) ≥ f(b) .Since $f$ is a differentiable function over $I$ ,by the Mean Value Theorem there exists 
c∈(a,b) such that

f'(c) = (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)

Since f(a) ≥ f(b) we know that f(b) - f(a) ≤ 0 .Also, $a<b$ tells us that $b-a>0$ .We conclude that

f'(c)=(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)≤0

However, f'(x) > 0 for all x ∈ I This is a contradiction, and therefore $f$ must be an increasing function over $I.$ 口

# 4.5|Derivatives and theShapeof a Graph

Earlier in this chapter we stated that if a function $f$ has a local extremum at a point $C$ ，then $c$ must be a critical point of $f$ .However, a function is not guaranteed to have a local extremum at a critical point. For example, $f(x)=x^3$ has a critical point at $x=0$ since f'(x)=3x² is zero at $x=0$ but $f$ does not have a local extremum at $x=0$ . Using the results from the previous section, we are now able to determine whether a critical point of a function actually corresponds to a local extreme value. In this section, we also see how the second derivative provides information about the shape of a graph by describing whether the graph of a function curves upward or curves downward.

## The First Derivative Test

Corollary 3 of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function is positive over an interval $I$ thenthe function is increasing over $I.$ On the other hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval $I$ ，then the function is decreasing over $I$ as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fX9WfAFN6elYmwU3zgcSB7EfFc5SFsqh6.png)
(a, b). At each point $x$ ， the derivative f'(x) > 0 .Both

functions are decreasing over the interval $(a,b)$ .At each point $x.$ the derivative f'(x) < 0

A continuous function $f$ has a local maximum at point $U$ if and only if $f$ switches from increasing to decreasing at point $C$ . Similarly, $f$ has a local minimum at $C$ if and only if $f$ switches from decreasing to increasing at $C$ If $f$ is a continuous function over an interval $I$ containing $C$ and differentiable over $I$ ，except possibly at C the only way $f$ can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point $C$ is if f'' changes sign as $X$ increases through $C$ .If $f$ is differentiable at $C$ ，the only way that f' .can change sign as $X$ increases through L is if f'(c)=0 . Therefore, for a function $f$ that is continuous over an interval $I$ containing C and differentiable over $I$ ，except possibly at $C$ ，the only way $f$ can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined. Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function $f$ ，we look for points $C$ in the domain of $f$ such that f'(c)=0 or f'(c) is undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of $f$

Note that $f$ need not have a local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are candidates for local extrema only. In Figure 4.31, we show that if a continuous function $f$ has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function may not have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if $f$ has a local extremum at a critical point, then the sign of f' switches as $x$ increases through that point

![](./images/fSkp5BQKl1GkFT5FOBpzrmbP3fvRVu12n.png)
Figure 4.31 The function $f$ has four critical points: α, $b$ $C$ ，and $d$ The function $f$ has local maxima at a

and $d$ and a local minimum at $b$ .The function $f$ does not have a local extremum at $c$ .The sign of f changes at all local extrema.

Using Fiqure 4.31,we summarize the main results regarding local extrema

·If a continuous function $f$ has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point $C$ ·The function has a local extremum at the critical point $C$ if and only if the derivative f' switches sign as $X$ increases through $C$ •Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point $C$ ，we must determine the sign of f'(x) to the left and right of $C$

This result is known as the first derivative test.

# Theorem 4.9: First Derivative Test

Suppose that $f$ is a continuous function over an interval $I$ containing a critical point $C$ .If $f$ is differentiable over $I$ ，except possibly at point $c$ ，then $f(c)$ satisfies one of the following descriptions:

i.If f' changes sign from positive when $x<c$ to negative when $x>c$ ，then $f(c)$ is a local maximum of $f$ il.If f' changes sign from negative when $x<c$ to positive when $x>c$ ，then $f(c)$ is a local minimum of $f$ ii If f' has the same sign for $x<c$ and $x>c$ then $f(c)$ is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of $f$

We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.

## Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test

 Consider a function $f$ that is continuous over an interval $I$

1. Find all critical points of $f$ and divide the interval $I$ into smaller intervals using the critical points as endpoints. 2. Analyze the sign of f' in each of the subintervals. If f' is continuous over a given subinterval (which is typically the case), then the sign of f' in that subinterval does not change and, therefore, can be determined by choosing an arbitrary test point $X$ in that subinterval and by evaluating the sign of f' at that test point. Use the sign analysis to determine whether $f$ is increasing or decreasing over that interval. 3.Use First Derivative Test and the results of step 2 to determine whether $f$ has a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular functions.

# Example 4.17

## Using the First Derivative Test to Find Local Extrema

Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for $f(x)=x^{3}-3x^{2}-9x-1$ .Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

### Solution

Step 1. The derivative is f'(x)=3x²-6x-9 . To find the critical points, we need to find where f'(x)=0 Factoring the polynomial, we conclude that the critical points must satisfy

$$3(x^2-2x-3)=3(x-3)(x+1)=0.$$

Therefore, the critical points are $x=3,-1$ .Now divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the smaller intervals (-∞, -1) , (1, 3) and 
(3, ∞) 000

Step 2. Since f' is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f'(x) over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a point over each of the intervals (-∞, -1) , (1, 3) and (3, ∞ ) and determine the sign of f' at each

of these points. For example, let's choose $x=-2$ ， $x=0$ ,and $x=4$ as test points.


Interval|Test Point|Sign of f′(x) = 3(x-3)(x+1) at Test Point|Conclusion<br>
(-∞,-1)|x=-2|(+)(-)(-)=+|is increasing<br>
(-1,3)|x=0|(+)(-)(+)=-|is decreasing<br>
(3,∞)|x=4|(+)(+)(+)=+|is increasing<br>


Step 3. Since f' switches sign from positive to negative as $X$ increases through $1,f$ f $f$ has a local maximum a $x=-1$ . Since f' switches sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through 3, $f$ has a local minimum at $x=3$ .These analytical results agree with the following graph

![](./images/fVN4MaqpD4VgIaHoaq6SvUh9KFCLgirRk.png)
Figure 4.32 The function $f$ has a maximum at $x=-1$ and

a minimum at $x=3$

## Example 4.18

### Using the First Derivative Test

Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for $f(x)=5x^{1/3}-x^{5/3}$ .Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

### Solution

Step 1. The derivative is

f'(x) = (5/(3x²/³)) - (5x²/³)/3 = (5(1-x⁴/³))/(3x²/³)

The derivative f'(x) = 0 when $1-x^{4/3}=0$ . Therefore, f'(x) = 0 at x=±1 .The derivative f'(x) is undefined at $x=0$ Therefore, we have three critical points: $x= 0$, $x= 1$ ，and $x=-1$ .Consequently divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the smaller intervals (-∞, -1) --1 (-∞, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1) ,and (1,∞) 000

Step 2: Since f' is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a test point $x$ in each of the intervals from step 1 and determine the sign of f' at each of these points.The points $x=-2$ x = -1/2, x=1/2, and $x=2$ are test points for these intervals.


Interval|Test Point|5(1-x^(4/3))/3x^(2/3) Sign of f′(x) at Test Point|Conclusion<br>
(-∞,-1)|x=-2|+(+)(-)=+|f is decreasing<br>
(-1,0)|x=-1/2|+(+)(+)=+|is increasing<br>
(0,1)|x=1/2|+(+)(+)=+|is increasing<br>
(1,∞)|x=2|+(+)(-)=-|f is decreasing<br>


Step 3: Since $f$ is decreasing over the interval (-∞, -1) and increasing over the interval (-1,0) ， $f$ has a local minimum at $x=-1$ . Since $f$ is increasing over the interval (-1, 0) and the interval (0, 1), $f$ does not have a local extremum at $x=0$ .Since $f$ is increasing over the interval (O, 1) and decreasing over the interval (1, ∞ ∞ $f$ has a local maximum at $x=1$ .The analytical results agree with the following graph

![](./images/ftrwvZ3G1WmdAud8HEvTpF8IWMn9L9PHI.png)

and a local maximum at $x=1$

4.17Use the first derivative test to find allocal extrema for f(x)=∛(x-1)

# Concavity and Points of Inflection

We now know how to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing. However, there is another issue to consider regarding the shape of the graph of a function. If the graph curves, does it curve upward or curve downward? This notion is called the concavity of the function.

Figure 4.34(a) shows a function $f$ with a graph that curves upward. As $x$ increases, the slope of the tangent line increases. Thus, since the derivative increases as $x$ increases, f' is an increasing function. We say this function $f$ is concave up. Figure 4.34(b) shows a function $f$ that curves downward. As $x$ increases, the slope of the tangent line decreases. Since the derivative decreases as $x$ increases, f' is a decreasing function. We say this function $f$ is concave down.

### Definition

Let $f$ be a function that is differentiable over an open interval $I.$ If f' is increasing over $I$ ，we say $f$ is concave up over $I.$ If f' is decreasing over $I$ we say $f$ is concave down over $I$

![](./images/fWpoWKpQ1QhIH5wDuXg9YKWgGBHIOSVKM.png)
Figure 4.34 (a),(c) Since f' is increasing over the interval (a, b), we say $f$

is concave up over $(a,b)$ . (b), (d) Since f' is decreasing over the interval $(a,b)$ we say $f$ is concave down over $(a,b)$

In general, without having the graph of a function $f$ how can we determine its concavity? By definition, a function $f$ is concave up if f' is increasing. From Corollary 3, we know that if f' is a differentiable function, then f' is increasing if its derivative f''(x) > 0 .Therefore, a function $f$ that is twice differentiable is concave up when f*(x)>0 . Similarly, a function $f$ is concave down if f' is decreasing. We know that a differentiable function f' is decreasing if its derivative f*(x) < 0 . Therefore, a twice-differentiable function $f$ is concave down when f''(x) < 0 .Applying this logic is known as the concavity test.

## Theorem 4.10: Test for Concavity

Let $f$ be a function that is twice differentiable over an interval $I$

i.If f''(x) > 0 for all x∈I ，then $f$ is concave up over $I$ ilIf f''(x) < 0 for all x∈I ，then $f$ is concave down over I.

We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function $f$ by looking at the second derivative of $f.$ In addition, we observe that a function $f$ can switch concavity (Figure 4.35). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only at a point $X$ if f^α(x)=0 or f''(x) is undefined. Consequently, to determine the intervals where a function $f$ is concave up and concave down, we look for those values of $X$ where f''(x)=0 or f'(x) is undefined. When we have determined

these points, we divide the domain of $f$ into smaller intervals and determine the sign of $f^{n}$ over each of these smaller intervals. If f'' changes sign as we pass through a point X then $f$ changes concavity. It is important to remember that a function $f$ may not change concavity at a point $X$ even if f'(x) = 0 or f''(x) is undefined. If, however, $f$ does change concavity at a point $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $a$ ，we say the point (a, $f(a))$ is an inflection point of $f$

## Definition

If $f$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ changes concavity at $a$ ，the point $(a,f(a))$ is an inflection point of $f$

![](./images/fNXaC9yXgioo8Rfn078Ui6pAsmlsvIy0c.png)
Figure 4.35 Since f''(x) > 0 for $x<a$ the function $f$ is concave up over the interval

(−∞ ,a). Since f''(x) < 0 for $x>a$ ，the function $f$ is concave down over the interval $( a$, ∞ 000 .The point (a, $f(a))$ is an inflection point of $f$

# Example 4.19

## Testing for Concavity

For the function $f(x)=x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x+30$ ,determine all intervals where $f$ is concave up and all intervals where $f$ is concave down. List all inflection points for $f$ Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

# Solution

To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f''(x) .The first derivative is f′(x)=3x²−12x+9 ，so the second derivative is f''(x) = 6x-12 . If the function changes concavity, it occurs either when f''(x)=0 or f''(x) is undefined. Since f'' is defined for all real numbers $X$ ，we need only find where f''(x)=0 .Solving the equation $6x-12=0$ we see that $x=2$ is the only place where $f$ could change concavity. We now test points over the intervals (-∞, 2) and (2, ∞ to determine the concavity of $f$ The points $x=0$ and $x=3$ are test points for these intervals.


Interval|Test Point|Sign of f″(x)=6x-12 at Test Point|Conclusion<br>
(-∞,2)|x=0|-|f is concave down<br>
(2,∞)|x=3|+|is concave up<br>


We conclude that $f$ is concave down over the interval (-∞), 2) and concave up over the interval (2, ∞ .Since $f$ changes concavity at $x=2$ ，the point (2, $f( 2) ) = ( 2$, 32) is an inflection point. Figure 4.36 confirms the analytical results.

![](./images/f5q1drL4bVQpRCqFQfaUrqt2grrYLCRLU.png)
Figure 4.36 The given function has a point of inflection at

(2, 32) where the graph changes concavity

4.18For f(x)=-x³+(3/2)x²+18x ,find all intervals where $f$ is concave up and all intervals where $f$ is concave down.

We now summarize, in Table 4.1, the information that the first and second derivatives of a function $f$ provide about the graph of $f$ and illustrate this information in Figure 4.37.


Sign of f′|Sign of f″|Is f increasing or decreasing?|Concavity<br>
Positive|Positive|Increasing|Concave up<br>
Positive|Negative|Increasing|Concave down<br>
Negative|Positive|Decreasing|Concave up<br>
Negative|Negative|Decreasing|Concave down<br>

Figure 4.37 Consider a twice-differentiable function $f$ over an open interval $I.$ If f'(x) > 0 for all x∈I ，the

function is increasing over $I$ If f'(x) < 0 for all x∈I the function is decreasing over $I.$ If f''(x) > 0 for all x∈I ，the function is concave up. If f''(x) < 0 for all x∈I ,the function is concave down on $I$

## The Second Derivative Test.

The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but the second derivative can also be used to locate extreme values. Using the second derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.

We know that if a continuous function has a local extrema, it must occur at a critical point. However, a function need not have a local extrema at a critical point. Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let $f$ be a twice-differentiable function such that f'(a) = 0 and f'' is continuous over an open interval $I$ containing $d$ Suppose f''(a)<0 .Since f'' is continuous over $I$ ， f''(x) < 0 for all x∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3, f' is a decreasing function over $I$ Since f'(a)=0 we conclude that for all x∈I ， f'(x) > 0 if $X<a$ and f'(x) < 0 if $X>u$ Therefore, by the first derivative test, $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$ . On the other hand, suppose there exists a point $b$ such that f'(b)=0 but f''(b)>0 .Since $f^{r}$ is continuous over an open interval $I$ containing $b$ ，then f''(x) > 0 for all x∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3, f' f f' is an increasing function overe $I$ Since f′(b)=0 ,we conclude that for all x∈I xEI x∈I, 
f'(x) < 0 if $x<b$ and f'(x) > 0 if $x>b$ .Therefore, by the first derivative test, $f$ has a local minimum at $x=b$

![](./images/f9RFzTPnrMRfiVgwPFx0N2AWE1D9NQDDt.png)

Figure 4.38 Consider a twice-differentiable function $f$ such that f'' is continuous. Since f'(a)=0 and f''(a)<0 there is an interval $I$ containing $a$ such that for all $X$ in $I$ ，f is increasing if $x<a$ and $f$ is decreasing if $x>a$ .As a result, $f$ has a local maximum at $x=a$ .Since f'(b)=0 and f''(b)>0 ,there is an interval $I$ containing $b$ such that for all $X$ in $I$, $f$ f $f$ is decreasing if $x<b$ and $f$ is increasing if $x>b$ .As a result, $f$ has a local minimum at $x=b$

# Theorem 4.11: Second Derivative Test

Suppose f'(c)=0 f'' is continuous over an interval containing $C$

i.If f''(c)>0 ，then $f$ has a local minimum at $C$ ii.If f''(c) < 0 ，then $f$ has a local maximum at c iiIf f''(c) = 0 ,，then the test is inconclusive.

Note that for case ii. when f''(c) = 0 then $f$ may have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at $C$ .For example, the functions $f( x) = x^{3}$, $f( x) = x^{4}$, and $f(x)=-x^{4}$ all have critical points at $x=0$ In each case, the second derivative is zero at $x=0$ However, the function $f(x)=x^{4}$ has a local minimum at $x=0$ whereas the function $f(x)=-x^{4}$ has a local maximum at $X$ and the function $f(x)=x^{3}$ does not have a local extremum at $x=0$ Let's now look at how to use the second derivative test to determine whether $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at a critical point C where f'(c)=0

# Example 4.20

Using the Second Derivative Test

Use the second derivative to find the location of all local extrema for $f(x)=x^{5}-5x^{3}$

## Solution

To apply the second derivative test, we first need to find critical points $C$ where f'(c)=0 .The derivative is

## f'(x)=5x⁴-15x² . Therefore, f'(x)=5x⁴-15x²=5x²(x²-3)=0 when x = 0, ±V3.

To determine whether $f$ has a local extrema at any of these points, we need to evaluate the sign of f'' at these points. The second derivative is

f''(x)=20x³-30x=10x(2x²-3)

In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the critical points and use the second derivative test to determine whether $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points


x|f″(x)|Conclusion<br>
-√3|-30√3|Local maximum<br>
0|0|Second derivative test is inconclusive<br>
√3|30√3|Local minimum<br>


By the second derivative test, we conclude that $f$ has a local maximum at 
x=-√3 and $f$ has a local minimum at x=√3 The second derivative test is inconclusive at $x=0$ To determine whether $f$ has a local extrema a $x=0$ we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of f'(x)=5x²(x²-3) for x ∈ (-√3, 0) and x∈(0, √3, let $x=-1$ and $x=1$ be the two test points. Since 
f'(-1)<0 and f'(1)<0 we conclude that $f$ is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, $f$ does not have a local extrema at $x=0$ as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/fXShWACxRXoEaNU8eAKed9Do73ENEtFVZ.png)

x=-√3 and a local minimum at x=√3

4.19 Consider the function f(x) = x³ - (3/2)x² - 18x . The points $c=3,-2$ -2 -2 satisfy f'(c)=0 Use the second derivative test to determine whether $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at those points.

We have now developed the tools we need to determine where a function is increasing and decreasing, as well as acquired an understanding of the basic shape of the graph. In the next section we discuss what happens to a function as x → ±∞ At that point, we have enough tools to provide accurate graphs of a large variety of functions.

We have shown how to use the first and second derivatives of a function to describe the shape of a graph. To graph a function $f$ defined on an unbounded domain, we also need to know the behavior of $f$ as x → ±∞ In this section,we define limits at infinity and show how these limits affect the graph of a function. At the end of this section, we outline a strategy for graphing an arbitrary function $f$

# Limits at Infinity

We begin by examining what it means for a function to have a finite limit at infinity. Then we study the idea of a function with an infinite limit at infinity.Back in Introduction to Functions and Graphs,we looked at vertical asymptotes; in this section we deal with horizontal and oblique asymptotes.

## Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes.

Recall that 
lim(x→a) f(x) = L means $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ as long as $X$ is sufficiently close to $u$ .We can extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the function f(x)=2+1/x .As can be seen graphically in Figure 4.40 and numerically in Table 4.2, as the values of λ get larger, the values of $f(x)$ approach 2. We say the limit as $X$ approaches 00 of $f(x)$ is 2 and write limₓ→∞f(x)=2 .Similarly, for $x<0$ ,as the values $|x|$ get larger, the values of $f(x)$ approaches 2. We say the limit as $X$ approaches -∞ of $f(x)$ is 2 and write lim_(x→-∞)f(x)=2

More generally, for any function $f$ ,we say the limit as x→∞ of $f(x)$ is $L$ if $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ as long as $X$ is sufficiently large. In that case, we write lim_(x→∞)f(x)=L .Similarly, we say the limit as x→-∞ of $f(x)$ is $L$ if $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ as long as $x<0$ and $|x|$ is sufficiently large. In that case, we write lim_(x→-∞)f(x) = L . We now lok at the definition of a function having a limi at infinity.

## Definition

(Informal) If the values of $f(x)$ become arbitrarily close to $L$ as X becomes sufficiently large, we say the function $f$ has a limit at infinity and write

lim(x→∞)f(x) = L

If the values of $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ for $x<0$ as $|x|$ becomes sufficiently large, we say that the function $f$ has a limit at negative infinity and write

lim_(x→-∞)f(x)=L

If the values $f(x)$ are getting arbitrarily close to some finite value $L$ as x→∞ or x→-∞ ，the graph of $f$ approaches the line $y=L$ . In that case, the line $y=L$ is a horizontal asymptote of $f$ (Figure 4.41). For example, for the function f(x) = 1/x, since lim_(x→∞)f(x)=0 ，the line $y=0$ is a horizontal asymptote of f(x) = 1/x

#  Definition

If lim_(x→∞)f(x)=L or lim_(x→-∞)f(x) = L we say the line $y=L$ is a horizontal asymptote of $f$

Figure 4.41 (a) As x→∞ ,the values of $f$ are getting arbitrarily close to $L$ The line $y=L$

is a horizontal asymptote of $f.$ (b) As x→-∞ ，the values of $f$ are getting arbitrarily close to $M$ .The line $y=M$ is a horizontal asymptote of $f$

A function cannot cross a vertical asymptote because the graph must approach infinity (or -∞ )from at least one direction as $X$ approaches the vertical asymptote. However, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote. In fact, a function may cros a horizontl asymptote an unlimited number o times For example,the funtion f(x) = (cos x)/x + 1 shown in Figure 4.42 intersects the horizontal asymptote $y=1$ an infinite number of times as it oscillates around the asymptote with everdecreasing amplitude

Figure 4.42 The graph of f(x)=(cosx)/x+1 Crosses its

horizontal asymptote $y=1$ an infinite number of times.

The algebraic limit laws and squeeze theorem we introduced in Introduction to Limits also apply to limits at infinity. We illustrate how to use these laws to compute several limits at infinity

# Example 4.21

## Computing Limits at Infinity

For each of the following functions $f$ evaluate lim_(x→∞)f(x) and lim_(x→-∞)f(x) . Determine the horizontal asymptote(s) for $f$

a. f(x) = 5 - 2/x²  b. f(x) = sin x/x  c. f(x) = tan⁻¹(x)

### Solution

![](./images/fwK646Ape88THOpey1y1nFbLpgH6c6nrG.png)

Similarly, lim_(x→-∞)f(x) = 5 . Therefore, f(x) = 5 - 2/x² has a horizontal asymptote of $y=5$ and $f$ approaches this horizontal asymptote as x → ±∞ as shown in the following graph.

![](./images/f8Cbbus6yOmiVviNg4K0EcstRIlYzIW9k.png)
Figure 4.43 This function approaches a horizontal asymptot

as x → ±∞

b.Since -1≤sinx≤1 for all $x$ we have

-1/x ≤ sin x/x ≤ 1/x

for all x ≠ 0 Also, since

lim_(x→∞) (-1/x) = 0 = lim_(x→∞) (1/x)

we can apply the squeeze theorem to conclude that

lim_(x→∞)(sin x)/x=0

Similarly,

lim_(x→-∞) (sin x)/x = 0

Thus, f(x) = sin x/x has a horizontal asymptote of $y=0$ and $f(x)$ approaches this horizontal asymptote as x → ±∞ as shown in the following graph

![](./images/fIWtnwvuxYTBrqosqhqLsfMpSrT2YZnvR.png)
Figure 4.44 This function crosses its horizontal asymptote multiple times.

C. To evaluate limₓ→∞tan⁻¹(x) and lim_(x→-∞)tan⁻¹(x) ，we first consider the graph of y=tan(x) over the interval (-π/2, π/2) as shown in the following graph

![](./images/fhIyH7YyWb4niqLMmFys0iGehTeIw15lv.png)
Figure 4.45 The graph of tan $x$ has vertical asymptotes at

x = ±π/2

Since

limₓ→(π/2)⁻ tan x = ∞

it follows that

limₓ→∞tan⁻¹(x)=π/2.

Similarly, since

lim_(x→(-π/2)⁺) tan x = -∞

it follows that

lim(x→-∞) tan⁻¹(x) = -π/2

As a result, y = π/2 and y = -π/2 are horizontal asymptotes of f(x)=tan⁻¹(x) as shown in the following graph.

### Infinite Limits at Infinity

Sometimes the values of a function $f$ become arbitrarily large as x→∞ (or as x→-∞ ). In this case, we write lim(x→∞)f(x)=∞ (or limₓ→⁻∞f(x) = ∞ ). On the other hand if the values of $f$ are negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude as x→∞ (or as x→-∞ ), we write lim(x→∞)f(x)=-∞ (or lim<sub>x→-∞</sub>f(x)=-∞

For example, consider the function $f(x)=x^3$ .As seen in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.47, as x→∞ the values $f(x)$ become arbitrarily large. Therefore, lim(x→∞)x³ = ∞ .On the other hand, as x→-∞ ， the values of $f(x)=x^3$ are negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude. Consequently, lim_(x→-∞)x³=-∞

$x$|10|20|50|100|1000
3 $x$|1000|8000|125,000|1,000,000|1,000,000,000
$x$|-10|-20|-50|-100|-1000

Figure 4.47For this function, the functional values approach infinity as

x → ±∞

### Definition

(Informal) We say a function $f$ has an infinite limit at infinity and write

lim_(x→∞)f(x) = ∞

if $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily large for $X$ sufficiently large.We say a function has a negative infinitelimit at infinity and write

lim(x→∞)f(x)=-∞.

if $f(x)<0$ and $|f(x)|$ becomes arbitrarily large for $X$ sufficiently large. Similarly, we can define infinite limits as x→-∞

## Formal Definitions

Earlier, we used the terms arbitrarily close, arbitrarily large, and sufficiently large to define limits at infinity informally Although these terms provide accurate descriptions of limits at infinity, they are not precise mathematically. Here are more formal definitions of limits at infinity.We then look at how to use these definitions to prove results involving limits at infinity.

### Definition

 (Formal) We say a function $f$ has a limit at infinity, if there exists a real number $L$ such that for all ε > 0 there exists $N>0$ such that

|f(x)-L|<ε

for all $x>N$ In that case, we write

lim_(x→∞)f(x)=L

### (see Figure 4.48)

We say a function $f$ has a limit at negative infinity if there exists a real number $L$ such that for all ε > 0 there exists $N<0$ such that

|f(x)-L|<ε

for all $x<N$ In that case, we write

lim_(x→-∞)f(x)=L

![](./images/ft9HH5IWgUltsfA06k688nxqUMkldWYgF.png)
Figure 4.48 For a function with a limit at infinity, for all

$x>N$ x > N $x> N$, |f(x)-L|<ε

Earlier in this section, we used graphical evidence in Figure 4.40 and numerical evidence in Table 4.2 to conclude that lim_(x→∞)(2+1/x)=2 .Here weuse theformaldfinition of lmit at infinity to prove thisresult rigorously

## Example 4.22 A Finite Limit at Infinity Example

Use the formal definition of limit at infinity to prove that lim_(x→∞)(2+1/x)=2

### Solution

Let ε > 0 .Let 
N=1/ε Therefore, for all $x>N$ ，we have

|2 + 1/x - 2| = |1/x| = 1/x < 1/N = ε.

![](./images/fRUnpIg84ogWGSgg7PKRaG9WExub0nglL.png)

4.Usld lim_(x→∞) (3 - 1/x²) = 3

We now turn our attention to a more precise definition for an infinite limit at infinity.

## Definition

(Formal) We say a function $f$ has an infinite limit at infinity and write

limₓ→∞f(x)=∞

if for all $M>0$ , there exists an $N>0$ such that

$$f(x)>M$$

for all $x>N$ (see Figure 4.49).

We say a function has a negative infinite limit at infinity and write

lim_(x→∞) f(x) = -∞

if for all $M<0$ there exists an $N>0$ such that

$$f(x)<M$$

for all $x>N$

Similarly we can define limits as x→-∞

![](./images/fYTc6Q5Sw04yGXT26Wbng4wHaiIzzha0G.png)
Figure 4.49For a function with an infinite limit at infinity, for

all $x>N$ x > N $x> N$, $f( x) > M$

Earlier, we used graphical evidence (Figure 4.47) and numerical evidence (Table 4.3) to conclude that lim(x→∞)x³ = ∞ Here we use the formal definition of infinite limit at infinity to prove that result.

## Example 4.23 An Infinite Limit at Infinity

Use the fomal definition of infinite limit at ifinityto prove that lim(x→∞)x³=∞

### Solution

Let $M>0$ .Let N = ³√M Then, for all $x>N$ ，we have

x³ > N³ = (³√M)³ = M

Therefore, lim(x→∞)x³ = ∞

![](./images/fI9GMQU4RgcBAsmwhwKz3f9v92HZTgizp.png)

4.22 Use the formal definition of infinite imit a infinity to prove that limₓ→∞3x²=∞

## End Behavior

The behavior of a function as x → ±∞ is called the function's end behavior. At each of the function's ends, the function could exhibit one of the following tvpes of behavior

1.The function $f(x)$ approaches a horizontal asymptote $y=L$

2. The function f(x)→∞ or f(x)→-∞

3. The function does not approach a finite limit, nor does it approach ∞ or -∞ . In this case, the function may have some oscillatory behavior.

Let's consider several classes of functions here and look at the different types of end behaviors for these functions.

End Behavior for Polynomial Functions

Consider the power function $f(x)=x^n$ where 71 is a positive integer. From Figure 4.50 and Figure 4.51, we see that

lim<sub>x→∞</sub>xⁿ=∞; n=1, 2, 3,...

and

![](./images/fEBqRtoluGthFNDyqe7BSU6fSYR598IBb.png)
Figure 4.50 For power functions with an even power of $n$

lim_(x→∞)xⁿ=∞=lim_(x→-∞)xⁿ

![](./images/fWOXgM8PZZ7Kmm0ArYbixGwA8HFFvEHeG.png)
Figure 4.51 For power functions with an odd power of $n$

lim_(x→∞)xⁿ=∞ and lim_(x→-∞)xⁿ=-∞

Using these facts, it is not difficult to evaluate lim cx” andlim cx”,where $C$ is any constant and 71 is a positive integer. If $c>0$ the graph of $y=cx^n$ is a vertical stretch or compression of $y=x^{n}$ ,and therefore

lim<sub>x→∞</sub>cx<sup>n</sup>=lim<sub>x→∞</sub>x<sup>n</sup> and lim<sub>x→-∞</sub>cx<sup>n</sup>=lim<sub>x→-∞</sub>x<sup>n</sup> if c>0.

If $c<0$ ，the graph of $y=cx^n$ is a vertical stretch or compression combined with areflection about the $x$ -axis, and therefore

limₓ→∞ cxⁿ = -limₓ→∞ xⁿ and limₓ→-∞ cxⁿ = -limₓ→-∞ xⁿ if c < 0.

If $c=0$ $y=cx^{n}=0$ ，in which case lim<sub>x→∞</sub>cx<sup>n</sup>=0=lim<sub>x→-∞</sub>cx<sup>n</sup>

## Example 4.24

## Limits at Infinity for Power Functions

For each function $f$ .evaluate lim_(x→∞)f(x) and lim_(x→-∞)f(x)

a. f(x) = -5x³  b. f(x) = 2x⁴

### Solution

a.Since the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is -5 ，the graph of $f(x)=-5x^{3}$ involves a vertical stretch and reflection of the graph of $y=x^{3}$ about the $X$ -axis. Therefore, lim<sub>x→∞</sub>(-5x³) = -∞ and lim(x→-∞)(-5x³) = ∞ b.Since the coefficient of $x^{4}$ is 2, the graph of $f(x)=2x^{4}$ is a vertical stretch of the graph of $y=x^{4}$ Therefore, lim(x→∞)2x⁴=∞ and lim_(x→-∞)2x⁴=∞

![](./images/f64mT8O7xGdyVS2lBxGLbtr5zie0hXaBy.png)

4.23Let $f(x)=-3x^{4}$ . Find lim_(x→∞)f(x)

We now look at how the limits at infinity for power functions can be used to determine lim (x→±∞) f(x) for any polynomial function $f$ Consider a polynomial function

$$f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0$$

of degree n ≥ 1 so that aₙ≠0 .Factoring, we see thar

f(x)=aₙxⁿ(1+aₙ₋₁/aₙ(1/x)+...+a₁/aₙ(1/xⁿ⁻¹)+a₀/aₙxⁿ).

As x → ±∞ .all the terms inside the parentheses approach zero except the first term. We conclude tha

lim_(x→±∞) f(x) = lim_(x→±∞) aₙxⁿ

For example, the function $f(x)=5x^{3}-3x^{2}+4$ behaves like $g(x)=5x^{3}$ as x → ±∞ as shown in Figure 4.52 and Table 4.4.

### End Behavior for Algebraic Functions

The end behavior for rational functions and functions involving radicals is a little more complicated than for polynomials. In Example 4.25, we show tha the limits infinityof aioal function f(x)=p(x)/q(x) depend on the relatinship bet eer the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. To evaluate the limits at infinity for a rational function, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of X appearing in the denominator. This determines which term in the overall expression dominates the behavior of the function at large values of X

## Example 4.25

Determining End Behavior for Rational Functions

For each of the following functions, determine the limits as x→∞ and x→-∞ .Then, use this information to describe the end behavior of the function

a. f(x)=(3x-1)/(2x+5) (Note: The degreeo the numerator and the denominator ae the same.)

f(x) = (3x² + 2x) / (4x³ - 5x + 7) ote he t o . f(x)=(3x²+4x)/(x+2) (Note: The degreof numeratoris greaerthan the degreo the enominator.

### Solution

a.The highest power of $X$ in the denominator is $x.$ Therefore, dividing the numerator and denominator by $X$ and applying the algebraic limit laws, we see that

lim_(x→±∞) (3x-1)/(2x+5) = lim_(x→±∞) (3-1/x)/(2+5/x) = (lim_(x→±∞) (3-1/x)) / (lim_(x→±∞) (2+5/x)) = (lim_(x→±∞) 3 - lim_(x→±∞) 1/x) / (lim_(x→±∞) 2 + lim_(x→±∞) 5/x) = 3/2.

Since lim_(x→±∞) f(x) = 3/2, we know that y=3/2 is a horizontal asymptote fo this function as shown in the following graph

![](./images/fl0rU0yEBi30fuWc1fL3uuwq4ye22b7VN.png)
Figure 4.53 The graph of this rational function approaches a

horizontal asymptote as x → ±∞

b. Since the largest power of $X$ appearing in the denominator is $x^{3}$ ，divide the numerator and denominato by $x^{3}$ .After doing so and applying algebraic limit laws, we obtain

lim_(x→±∞)(3x² + 2x)/(4x³ - 5x + 7) = lim_(x→±∞)(3/x + 2/x²)/(4 - 5/x² + 7/x³) = (3(0) + 2(0))/(4 - 5(0) + 7(0)) = 0

Therefore $f$ has a horizontal asymptote of $y=0$ as shown in the following graph

![](./images/fNorGE3ImG6GYcaCK8AGs2DnkHoG70K9g.png)
Figure 4.54The graph of this rational function approaches

the horizontal asymptote $y=0$ as x → ±∞

C.Dividing the numerator and denominator by $X$ we have

lim<sub>x→±∞</sub>(3x² + 4x)/(x + 2) = lim<sub>x→±∞</sub>(3x + 4)/(1 + 2/x)

As x → ±∞ the denominator approaches 1. As x→∞ the numerator approaches +∞ .As x→-∞ , the numerator approaches -∞ . Therefore lim(x→∞)f(x)=∞ .whereas lim_(x→-∞) f(x) = -∞ as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fogGDapL0ox0IVLXnzmdhgPqYrzSVzuc9.png)
Figure 4.55 As x→∞ ，the values f(x)→∞ .As x→-∞ ，the

values f(x)→-∞

4.24 Evalate lim_(x→±∞) (3x² + 2x - 1)/(5x² - 4x + 7) anduse thee lmistdemine the end behavior 
f(x)=(3x²+2x-1)/(5x²-4x+7).

Before proceeding, consider the graph of f(x) = (3x²+4x)/(x+2) shown in Figure 4.56. As x→∞ and x→-∞ ，the graph of $f$ appears almost linear. Although $f$ is certainly not a linear function, we now investigate why the graph of $f$ seems to be approaching a linear function. First, using long division of polynomials, we can write

f(x) = (3x²+4x)/(x+2) = 3x-2+4/(x+2).

Since 4/(x+2)→0 as x → ±∞ ，we conclude that

lim<sub>x→±∞</sub>(f(x)-(3x-2))=lim<sub>x→±∞</sub>4/(x+2)=0

Therefore, the graph of $f$ approaches the line $y=3x-2$ as x → ±∞ .This line isknown as an oblique asymptote for $f$ (Figure 4.56)

![](./images/fGfYoTqCS2E2xCd5kUM07cMiRFxcFYlwU.png)
Figure 4.56 The graph of the rational function

f(x)=(3x²+4x)(x+2) approaches the oblique asymptote
y = 3x - 2 as x → ±∞

We can summarize the results of Example 4.25 to make the following conclusion regarding end behavior for rational functions. Consider a rational function

f(x)=p(x)/q(x)=(aₙxⁿ+aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹+...+a₁x+a₀)/(bₘxᵐ+bₘ₋₁xᵐ⁻¹+...+b₁x+b₀),

where aₙ≠0 and bₘ ≠ 0

1. If the degree of the numerator is the same as the degree of the denominator $(n=m)$ then $f$ has a horizontal asymptote of $y=a_{n}/b_{m}$ as x → ±∞

2.If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator $(n<m)$ ，then $f$ has a horizontal asymptote of $y=0$ as x → ±∞

3.If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator $(n>m)$ .then $f$ does not have a

horizontal asymptote. The limits at infinity are either positive or negative infinity, depending on the signs of the leading terms. In addition,using long division, the function can be rewritten as

f(x)=p(x)/q(x)=g(x)+r(x)/q(x)

where the degree of $r(x)$ is less than the degree of $q(x)$ .As a result,lim _r(x)/q(x) = O.Therefore,the values of [f(x) - g(x)] approach zero as x → ±∞ .If the degree of $p(x)$ is exactly one more than the degree of $q(x)$ $(n=m+1)$ ，the function $g(x)$ is a linear function. In this case, we call $g(x)$ an oblique asymptote Now let's consider the end behavior for functions involving a radical

## Example 4.26

Determining End Behavior for a Function Involving a Radical

Find the limits as x→∞ and x→-∞ for f(x)=(3x-2)/√(4x²+5) and describe the end behavior of $f$

## Solution

Let's use the same strategy as we did for rational functions: divide the numerator and denominator by a power of $X$ .To determine the appropriate power of $X$, consider the expression √(4x²+5) in the denominator. Since

√(4x²+5)≈√(4x²)=2|x|

for large values of $X$ in effect $X$ appears just to the first power in the denominator. Therefore, we divide the numerator and denominator by $|x|$ .Then, using the fact that $|x|=x$ for $x> 0$, $| x| = - x$ for $x<0$ ，and |x|=√x² for all $X$ ,we calculate the limits as follows:

lim_(x→∞)(3x-2)/√(4x²+5) = lim_(x→∞)(3-2/x)/√(4+5/x²) = 3/2; lim_(x→-∞)(3x-2)/√(4x²+5) = lim_(x→-∞)(-3+2/x)/√(4+5/x²) = -3/2

Therefore, $f(x)$ approaches the horizontal asymptote y=3/2 as X→00 and the horizontal symptote y=-3/2 as x→-∞ as shown in the following graph

### Determining End Behavior for Transcendental Functions

The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic and do not approach a finite limit as x → ±∞ .For example, sin.x oscillates between 1 and -1 (Figure 4.58). The tangent function $x$ has an infinite number of vertical asymptotes as x → ±∞ ; therefore, it does not approach a finite limit nor does it approach ±∞ as x → ±∞ as shown in Figure 4.59

![](./images/f8Ln6tUkZ0tsP83Gga7QiFt5Rkp5A8yy8.png)

Figure 4.59 The function f(x) = tan x does not approach a

Recall that for any base $b>0$ b≠1 ，the function $y=b^{x}$ is an exponential function with domain (-∞), ∞ and range (0, ∞ .If $b>1$ b >1 $b>1,y=b^{x}$ is increasing over (-∞), ∞ .If $0< b< 1$, $y= b^{x}$ is decreasing over (-∞), ∞ .For the natural exponential function $f( x) = e^{x}$, e≈2.718>1 . Therefore, $f(x)=e^{x}$ is increasing on (-∞), ∞ and the

range is ·(0, ∞ . The exponential function $f(x)=e^{x}$ approaches ∞0 as x→∞ and approaches 0 as x→-∞ as shown in Table 4.5and Figure 4.60.

Recall that the natural logarithm function 
16) f(x) = ln(x) is the inverse of the natural exponential function $y=e^{x}$ Therefore, the domain of 
16) f(x) = ln(x) is (0, ∞ and the range is (-∞), ∞ . The graph of 
16) f(x) = ln(x) is the reflection of the graph of $y=e^{x}$ about the line $y=x$ . Therefore, ln(x)→-∞ as x→0⁺ and ln(x)→∞ as x→∞ as shown inFigure 4.61 and Table 4.6

### Solution

To find the limit as x→∞ ，divide the numerator and denominator by e^λ

limₓ→∞f(x) = limₓ→∞(2+3eˣ)/(7-5eˣ) = limₓ→∞((2/eˣ)+3)/((7/eˣ)-5)

As shown in Figure 4.60, eˣ→∞ as x→∞ .Therefore,

lim<sub>x→∞</sub>(2/e<sup>x</sup>) = 0 = lim<sub>x→∞</sub>(7/e<sup>x</sup>)

We conclude that lim_(x→∞)f(x)=-3/5 and the graph of $f$ approaches the horizontal asymptote y=-3/5 as x→∞ .To find the limit as x→-∞ ，use the fact that eˣ→0 as x→-∞ to conclude that lim_f(x) = ，and therefore the graph of approaches the horizontal asymptote y = 2/7 as x→-∞

We now have enough analytical tools to draw graphs of a wide variety of algebraic and transcendental functions. Before showing how to graph specific functions, let's look at a general strategy to use when graphing any function.

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function

Given a function $f$ ,use the following steps to sketch a graph of $f$

1.Determine the domain of the function.

2. Locate the $x$ - and $y$ -intercepts. 3. Evaluate lim_(x→∞)f(x) and lim_(x→-∞)f(x) to determine the end behavior. If either of these limits is a finite number $L$ ，then $y=L$ is a horizontal asymptote.If either of these limits is 00 or -∞0 ,determine whether $f$ has an oblique asymptote. If $f$ is a rational function such that f(x)=p(x)/q(x) , where the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, then $f$ can be written as

f(x)=p(x)/q(x)=g(x)+r(x)/q(x)

where the degree of $r(x)$ is less than the degree of $q(x)$ . The values of $f(x)$ approach the values of $g(x)$ as

x→±∞ . If $g(x)$ is a linear function, it is known as an oblique asymptote. 4. Determine whether $f$ has any vertical asymptotes. 5. Calculate f' . Find all critical points and determine the intervals where $f$ is increasing and where $f$ is decreasing. Determine whether $f$ has any local extrema 6. Calculate f'' . Determine the intervals where $f$ is concave up and where $f$ is concave down. Use this information to determine whether $f$ has any inflection points. The second derivative can also be used as an alternate means to determine or verify that $f$ has a local extremum at a critical point

Now let's use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a polynomial function.

# Example 4.28

## Sketching a Graph of a Polynomial

Sketch a graph of $f(x)=(x-1)^{2}(x+2)$

### Solution

Step 1. Since $f$ is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.

Step 2. When $x=0$ ， $f(x)=2$ .Therefore, the $y$ -intercept is (O, 2). To find the $X$ -intercepts, we need to solve the equation $(x-1)^{2}(x+2)=0$ gives us the $X$ -intercepts (1, 0) and (—2, 0)

Step 3. We need to evaluate the end behavior of $f.$ As x→∞ x→∞ x→∞, (x-1)²→∞ and (x+2)→∞ . Therefore, lim(x→∞)f(x)=∞ . As x→-∞ x→-00 x → -∞, (x-1)²→∞ and (x+2)→-∞ . Therefore,e lim_(x→-∞) f(x) = -∞ . To get even more information about the end behavior of $f$ ,we can multiply the factors of $f$ When doing so, we see that

$$f(x)=(x-1)^2(x+2)=x^3-3x+2.$$

Since the leading term of $f$ is $x^3$ ，we conclude that $f$ behaves like $y=x^3$ as x → ±∞

Step 4. Since $f$ is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes

Step 5. The first derivative of $f$ is

f′(x)=3x²-3

Therefore, $f$ has two critical points: $x=1$ ， -1 .Divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the three smaller intervals (-∞, -1) -11and (1, ∞ 0000 .Then, choose test points $x= - 2$, $x= 0$ ，and $x=2$ from these intervals and evaluate the sign of f'(x) at each of these test points, as shown in the following table


Interval|Test Point|Sign of Derivative f′(x) = 3x² - 3 = 3(x - 1)(x + 1)|Conclusion
(-∞, -1)|$x=-2$|(+)(-)(-)=+|$is$ increasing
(-1, 1)|$x=0$|(+)(-)(+)=-|$f$ is decreasing
(1,∞)|$x=2$|(+)(+)(+)(+)=+ |is increasing

From the table, we see that $f$ has a local maximum at $x=-1$ and a local minimum at $x=1$ .Evaluating $f(x)$ at those two points, we find that the local maximum value is $f(-1)=4$ and the local minimum value is $f(1)=0$

Step 6. The second derivative of $f$ is

$$f''(x)=6x.$$

The second derivative is zero at $x=0$ .Therefore, to determine the concavity of $f$ ，divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the smaller intervals (-∞,0) and (0, ∞ , and choose test points $x=-1$ and $x=1$ to determine the concavity of $f$ on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table


Interval|Test Point|Sign of f''(x)=6x|Conclusiom
(-∞), 0)|$x=-1$| |$f$ is concave down
(0, ∞)|$x=1$|+|is concave $up.$

We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5, that $f$ has a local maximum at $x=-1$ and a local minimum at $x=1$ . In addition, the information found in step 5 —namely, $f$ has a local maximum at $x=-1$ and a local minimum at $x=1$ ，and f'(x) = 0 at those pointscombined with the fact that f'' changes sign only at $x=0$ confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of $f$ Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of $f(x)=(x-1)^{2}(x+2)$ shown in the following graph.

4.27 Sketch a graph of $f(x)=(x-1)^{3}(x+2)$

### Example 4.29

Sketching a Rational Function

Skech ne ahoe f(x)=x²/(1-x²)

### Solution

Step 1. The function $f$ is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the domain is the set of al real numbers $X$ except x=±1

Step 2. Find the intercepts. If $x=0$ ，then $f(x)=0$ ，so 0 is an intercept. If y = 0, then (x2) = ( which implies $x=0$ Therefore, (O, O) is the only intercept

Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since $f$ is a rational function, divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power in the denominator: $x^{2}$ We obtain

lim_(x→±∞) x²/(1-x²) = lim_(x→±∞) 1/((1/x²)-1) = -1

Therefore, $f$ has a horizontal asymptote of $y=-1$ as x→∞ and x→-∞

Step 4. To determine whether $f$ has any vertical asymptotes, first check to see whether the denominator has any zeroes. We find the denominator is zero when x=±1 .To determine whether the lines $x=1$ or $x=-1$ are vertical asymptotes of $f$ .evaluate lim_(x→1)f(x) and limₓ→₋₁f(x) . By looking at each one-sided limit as x→1 we see that

limx→1⁺x²/(1-x²)=-∞ and limx→1⁻x²/(1-x²)=∞.

In addition, by looking at each one-sided limit as x → -1 ，we find that

lim_(x→-1⁺) x²/(1-x²) = ∞ and lim_(x→-1⁻) x²/(1-x²) = -∞

Step 5. Calculate the first derivative

f'(x)=(1−x²)(2x)−x²(−2x)/(1−x²)²=2x/(1−x²)²

Critical points occur at points $X$ where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) is undefined. We see that f'(x) = 0 when $x=0$ The derivative f' is not undefined at any point in the domain of $f$ . However, x=±1 are not in the domain of $f$ Therefore, to determine where $f$ is increasing and where $f$ is decreasing, divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into four smaller intervals: (-∞, -1) ，(-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ∞ , and choose a test point in each interval to determine the sign of f'(x) in each of these intervals. The values x= -2, x= -， x= ， and $x=2$ are good choices for test points as shown in the following table.


Interval|Test Point|2x Sign of f'(x) - (1-1)|Conclusion
(-∞, -1)|$x=-2$|-/+=-1|$f$ is decreasing
(-1,0)|$x=-1/2$|-1+=-1|$f$ is decreasing
(0,1)|$x=1/2$|+/+=+|$f$ is increasing
(1,∞)|$x=2$|+/+=+|is increasing

From this analysis, we conclude that $f$ has a local minimum at $x=0$ but no local maximum.

Step 6.Calculate the second derivative

f''(x) = ((1-x²)²(2)-2x(2(1-x²)(-2x)))/(1-x²)⁴ = ((1-x²)[2(1-x²)+8x²])/(1-x²)⁴ = (2(1-x²)+8x²)/(1-x²)³ = (6x²+2)/(1-x²)³

To determine the intervals where $f$ is concave up and where $f$ is concave down, we first need to find all points $X$ where f''(x)=0 or f''(x) is undefined. Since the numerator 6x²+2≠0 for any $x$, f''(x) is never zero. Furthermore, $f^{r}$ is not undefined for any $x$ in the domain of $f$ .However, as discussed earlier, x=±1 are not in the domain of $f$ Therefore, to determine the concavity of $f$ we divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the three smaller intervals (-∞, -1) ， (-1,-1) ，and (1,∞ ),and choose a test point in each of these intervals to evaluate the sign of f''(x) .in each of these intervals. The values $x= - 2$, $x= 0$, x =0 $x=0$ and $x=2$ are possible test points as shown in the following table.


Interval|Test Point|$6x^{2}+2$ Sign of f''(x) (1 - x²)³|Conclusion
(-∞, -1)|$x=-2$|+1-=-1|$f$ is concave down
(-1,-1)|$x=0$|+/+ = +|$f$ is concave up.
(1, ∞)|$x=2$|+1-= -|is concave down

Combining all this information, we arrive at the graph of $f$ shown below. Note that, although $f$ changes concavity at $x=-1$ and $x=1$ ，there are no inflection points at either of these places because $f$ is not continuous at $x=-1$ or $x=1$

![](./images/fyni2CRP5WsllLCoFiTvrFppZiE0FgYEq.png)

4.2 ketcha graph of f(x) = (3x+5)/(8+4x)

## Example 4.30

Sketching a Rational Function with an Oblique Asymptote

Ssketch he graph of f(x) = x²/(x-1)

### Solution

Step 1. The domain of $f$ is the set of all real numbers $JI$ except $x=1$

Step 2. Find the intercepts. We can see that when $x= 0$, $f( x) = 0$, so(0,0) is the only intercept.

Step 3.Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, $f$ must have an oblique asymptote. To find the oblique asymptote, use long division of polynomials to write

f(x) = x²/ (x-1) = x + 1 + 1/(x-1)

Since 1/(x-1)→0 as x→±∞, $f( x)$ f(x) $f(x)$ approaches the line $y=x+1$ as x → ±∞ .The line $y=x+1$ is an oblique asymptote for $f$

Step 4. To check for vertical asymptotes, look at where the denominator is zero. Here the denominator is zero at $x=1$ . Looking at both one-sided limits as x→1 ,we find

lim_(x→1⁺)x²/(x-1)=∞ and lim_(x→1⁻)x²/(x-1)=-∞

Therefore, $x=1$ is a vertical asymptote, and we have determined the behavior of $f$ as $X$ approaches 1 from the right and the left.

Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:


f'(x)=((x-1)(2x)-x²(1))/(x-1)²=(x²-2x)/(x-1)²

We have f'(x) = 0 when $x^{2}-2x=x(x-2)=0$ . Therefore, $x=0$ and $x=2$ are critical points. Since $f$ is undefined at $x=1$ ，we need to divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the smaller intervals (-∞,0) (0,1), (1, 2), and (2, ∞ ,and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f'(x) in each of these smaller intervals. For example, let x = -1, x = ↓, x = , and $x=3$ be the test points as shown in the following table.

Interval|Test Point|Sign of f'(x) = (x²-2x)/2 $x(x-2)$ $(x-1)^{2}$ $(x-1)^{2}$|Conclusion
(-∞), 0)|$x=-1$|(-)(-)/+=+|is increasing
(0,1)|$x=1/2$|(+)(-)/+=-|is decreasing T
(1,2)|$x=3/2$|(+)(-)/+=-|$f$ is decreasing
(2, ∞)|$x=3$|(+)(+)/+=+|is increasing


From this table, we see that $f$ has a local maximum at $x=0$ and a local minimum at $x=2$ .The value of J at the local maximum is $f(0)=0$ and the value of $f$ at the local minimum is $f(2)=4$ . Therefore, (0,0) and (2, 4) are important points on the graph.

Step 6.Calculate the second derivative:

f<sup>α</sup>(x) = (x-1)²(2x-2) - (x²-2x)(2(x-1)) / (x-1)⁴ = (x-1)[(x-1)(2x-2) - 2(x²-2x)] / (x-1)⁴ = [(x-1)(2x-2) - 2(x²-2x)] / (x-1)³ = [2x²-4x+2 - (2x²-4x)] / (x-1)³ = 2/(x-1)³

We see that f''(x) is never zero or undefined for $x$ in the domain of $f$ Since $f$ is undefined at $x=1$ ，to check concavity we just divide the interval (-∞), ∞ into the two smaller intervals (-∞, 1) and (1,∞) and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f''(x) in each of these intervals. The values $x=0$

and $x=2$ are possible test points as shown in the following table.


Interval|Test Point|Sign of f''(x) = (x-1)³⁻|Conclusion
(−∞, 1)|$x=0$|+/-=-1|$f$ is concave down
(1, ∞)|$x=2$|+/+=+|$f$ is concave up.


From the information gathered, we arrive at the following graph for $f$

### Solution

Ste 1. i he eb- functio i defind o l ea pumes $X$ and (x-1)^(2/3)=(∛(x-1))² . thedomain of $f$ is all real numbers.

Step 2: To find the $y$ -intercept, evaluate $f(0)$ .Since $f(0)=1$ ，the $y$ -intercept is (O, 1). To find the $x$ -intercept, solve $(x-1)^{2/3}=0$ .The solution of this equation is $x=1$ ，so the $X$ -intercept is (1, 0).

Step 3: Since lim(x 1)2/3 = co, the function continues to grow without bound as x→∞ and x→-∞ Step 4: The function has no vertical asymptotes

Step 5: To determine where $f$ is increasing or decreasing, calculate f' .We find

f'(x) = 2/3(x-1)^(-1/3) = 2/(3(x-1)^(1/3))

This function is not zero anywhere, but it is undefined when $x=1$ Therefore, the only critical point is $x=1$ Divide the interval (-∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (-∞, 1) and (1,∞) ,and choose test points in each of these intervals to determine the sign of f'(x) in each of these smaller intervals. Let $x=0$ and $x=2$ be the test points as shown in the following table.


Interval|Test Point|Sign of f'(x) 2 1 二 $3(x-1)^{1/3}$|Conclusion
(-∞,1 1)|$x=0$|+1-=-1|$f$ is decreasing
∞ 11.|x=2|+/+=+|is increasing


We conclude that $f$ has a local minimum at $x=1$ . Evaluating $f$ at $x=1$ ,we find that the value of $f$ at the local minimum is zero. Note that f'(1) is undefined, so to determine the behavior of the function at this critical point, we need to examine limₓ→₁f'(x) . Looking at the one-sided limits, we have

lim_(x→1⁺) 2/(3(x - 1)^(1/3)) = ∞ and lim_(x→1⁻) 2/(3(x - 1)^(1/3)) = -∞

Therefore, $f$ has a cusp at $x=1$

Step 6: To determine concavity, we calculate the second derivative of $f$

f''(x) = -2/(9(x-1)^(4/3))

We find that f''(x) is defined for all $x$ but is undefined when $x=1$ .Therefore, divide the interval (-∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (-∞, 1) and (1,∞ ), and choose test points to evaluate the sign of f''(x) in eachof these intervals. As we did earlier, let $x=0$ and $x=2$ be test points as shown in the following table


Interval|Test Point|-2 Sign of f''(x) 二 $9(x-1)$|Conclusion
(−∞, 1)|$x=0$|-1+=-1|$f$ is concave down

From this table, we conclude that $f$ is concave down everywhere. Combining all of this information, we arrive at the following graph for $f$ .

# 4.7 | Applied Optimization Problems

# Learning Objectives

4.7.1Set up and solve optimizationproblems in several applied fields.

One common application of calculus is calculating the minimum or maximum value of a function. For example, companies often want to minimize production costs or maximize revenue. In manufacturing, it is often desirable to minimize the amount of material used to package a product with a certain volume. In this section, we show how to set up these types of minimization and maximization problems and solve them by using the tools developed in this chapter.

# Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval

The basic idea of the optimization problems that follow is the same. We have a particular quantity that we are interestec in maximizing or minimizing. However, we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in Example 4.32, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the garden as large as we like. Let's look at how we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.

# Example 4.32

Maximizing the Area of a Garden

A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides (Figure 4.62). Given 100 ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?

![](./images/f3UZyEu8faEdIePkdEFEGfgGkDoEgUmSX.png)

y that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100 ft of fencing.

## Solution

Let $x$ denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock wall and $y$ denote the length of the side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is

A = x·y

We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 10o ft.From Figure 4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be $2x+y$ Therefore, the constraint equation is

$$2x+y=100.$$

Solving this equation for $y$ ，we have $y=100-2x$ Thus, we can write the area as

A(x) = x(100-2x) = 100x - 2x²

Before trying to maximize the area function $A(x)=100x-2x^{2}$ ,we need to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive. Therefore, we need $x>0$ and $y>0$ .Since $y=100-2x$ ，if $y>0$ ，then $x<50$ .Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of $A(x)$ for $X$ over the open interval (0, 50). We do not know that a function necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let's consider the function $A(x)=100x-2x^{2}$ over the closed interval [0, 50]. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value $X$ in the open interval (O, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we consider the following problem:

Maximize $A(x)=100x-2x^{2}$ over the interval [0, 50]

As mentioned earlier, since $A$ is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At the endpoints, $A(x)=0$ .Since the area is positive for all $X$ in the open interval (0, 50), the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function $A(x)$ ，we obtain

A'(x) = 100 - 4x

Therefore, the only critical point is $x=25$ (Figure 4.63).We conclude that the maximum area must occur wher $x=25$ .Then we have $y=100-2x=100-2(25)=50$ To maximize the area of the garden, let $x=25$ ft and $y=50$ ft The area of this garden is 1250 ft²

![](./images/fLxpZ0Uf2P1VoupBYnLY9YDq4qdgS0ZxK.png)
Figure 4.63 To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the

maximum value of the function $A(x)=100x-2x^{2}$

4.31 Dermin the maximum area if we want to make the same rectangular garden a in Figure 4.63, but we have 200 ft of fencing

Now let's look at a general strategy for solving optimization problems similar to Example 4.32

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Optimization Problems

1. Introduce all variables. If applicable, draw a figure and label all variables 2. Determine which quantity is to be maximized or minimized, and for what range of values of the other variables (if this can be determined at this time). 3. Write a formula for the quantity to be maximized or minimized in terms of the variables. This formula may involve more than one variable 4. Write any equations relating the independent variables in the formula from step 3. Use these equations to write the quantity to be maximized or minimized as a function of one variable. 5. Identify the domain of consideration for the function in step 4 based on the physical problem to be solved. 6. Locate the maximum or minimum value of the function from step 4. This step typically involves looking for critical points and evaluating a function at endpoints.

Now let's apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a constraint on the amount of material to be used.

## Maximizing the Volume of a Box

An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a boxwith the maximum volume?

## Solution

Step 1:Let $x$ be the side length of the square to be removed from each corner (Figure 4.64). Then, the remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an open-top box. Let $V$ be the volume of the resulting box

![](./images/fRgZA3iLvp503DRwB2wYcZiMvXIsOaENM.png)
Figure 4.64A square with side length $x$ inches is removed from each

corner of the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an open-top box.

Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize $V$

Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is V = LWH ，where L, $W$ ，and $H$ are the length, width, and height, respectively

Step 4: From Figure 4.64, we se that the height of the box is X inches, the length is $36-2x$ inches, and the width is $24-2x$ inches.Therefore,the volume of the box is

$$V(x)=(36-2x)(24-2x)x=4x^{3}-120x^{2}+864x.$$

Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let's examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need $x>0$ Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 24 in.; otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there is a maximum volume of the box for $A$ over the open interval (0, 12). Since $V$ is a continuous function over the closed interval [0, 12], we know $V$ will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore we consider $V$ over the closed interval [O, 12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior point.

Step 6: Since $V(x)$ is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [0, 12], $V$ must have an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since $V(x)=0$ at the endpoints and $V(x)>0$ for $0<x<12$ ，the maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is

$$V'(x)=12x^{2}-240x+864.$$

To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation

$$12x^2-240x+864=0.$$

Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to solving the equatior

$$x^2-20x+72=0.$$

Using the quadratic formula.we find that the critical points are

x=(20±√((-20)²-4(1)(72)))/2=(20±√112)/2=(20±4√7)/2=10±2√7

Since 10+2√7 is not in the domain of consideration, the only critical point we need to consider is 10 - 2√7 Therefore,the volume is maximized if we let x=10-2√7 in.The maximum volume is V(10-2√7)=640+448√7≈1825 in 3 as shown in the following graph.

# Minimizing Travel Time

An island is $2mi$ due north of its closest point along a straight shoreline. A visitor is staying at a cabin on the shore that is 6mi west of that point. The visitor is planning to go from the cabin to the island. Suppose the visitor runs at a rate of 8 mph and swims at a rate of 3 mph .How far should the visitor run before swimming to minimize the time it takes to reach the island?

## Solution

Step 1: Let $x$ be the distance running and let $y$ be the distance swimming (Figure 4.66). Let $T$ be the time it takes to get from the cabin to the island.

![](./images/fngrz57tziQKD6hkbeIEL4lfC8YlWkGtt.png)
Figure 4.66 How can we choose $X$ and $y$ to minimize the travel time from

the cabin to the island?

Step 2: The problem is to minimize 7

Step 3: To find the time spent traveling from the cabin to the island, add the time spent running and the time spen swimming. Since Distance = Rate $x$ Time D = R × T, the time spent running is

Tᵣᵤₙₙᵢₙg = Dᵣᵤₙₙᵢₙg/Rᵣᵤₙₙᵢₙg = x/8,

and the time spent swimming is

T_swimming = D_swimming/R_swimming = y/3

Therefore, the total time spent traveling is

cosy=√(1-sin²y)

Step 4: From Figure 4.66, the line segment of $y$ miles forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $2mi$ and 6-x minᵢ₌₁ .Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, $2^{2}+(6-x)^{2}=y^{2}$, and we obtain y = √((6-x)² + 4) Thus, the total time spent traveling is given by the function

T(x) = x/8 + √((6-x)²+4)/3

Step 5: From Figure 4.66,we see that 0 ≤ x ≤ 6 .Therefore, [O, 6] is the domain of consideration

Step 6: Since $T(x)$ is a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval, it has a maximum and a minimum Let's begin by looking for any critical points of 7 over the interval O, 6] The derivative is

T'(x)=1/8-(1/2)[(6-x)²+4]⁻¹/²⋅2(6-x)/3=1/8-(6-x)/(3√((6-x)²+4))

If T'(x)=0 ，then

1/8=(6-x)/(3√((6-x)²+4)).

Therefore,

3√((6-x)²+4)=8(6-x).

Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if $X$ satisfies this equation, then $X$ must satisfy

9[(6 - x)² + 4] = 64(6 - x)²,

which implies

$$55(6-x)^2=36.$$

We conclude that if $X$ is a critical point. then $X$ satisfies

(x - 6)² = 36/55

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are

x=6±6/√55

Since x = 6 + 6/√55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a critical point. On the other hand x = 6 - 6/√55 is in the domain. Since we squared both sides of Equation 4.6 to arrive at the possible critical points, it remains to verify that x = 6 - 6/√55 satisfies Equation 4.6. Since x = 6 - 6/√55 does satisfy that equation, we conclude that x = 6 - 6/√55 is a critical point, and it is the only one. To justify that the time is minimized for this value of $x$ we just need to check the values of $T(x)$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=6$ and compare them with the value of $T(x)$ at the critical point x = 6 - 6/√55 We find that T(0)≈2.108 h and T(6)≈1.417 h whereas T66/55 1.368 h.Therefore, we conclude that 7 has a local minimum at x≈5.19 mi

4.33Suppose the island is l mi from shore, and the distance from the cabin to the point on the shore closest to the island is $15mi$ Suppose a visitor swims at the rate of 2.5 mph and runs at a rate of 6mph .Let $x$ denote the distance the visitor will run before swimming, and find a function for the time it takes the visitor to get from the cabin to the island.

In business, companies are interested in maximizing revenue. In the following example, we consider a scenario in which a company has collected data on how many cars it is able to lease, depending on the price it charges its customers to rent a car. Let's use these data to determine the price the company should charge to maximize the amount of money it brings in.

# Example 4.35

## Maximizing Revenue

Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers $p$ dollars per day to rent a car, where 50 ≤ p ≤ 200 ，the number of cars $n$ they rent per day can be modeled by the linear functior

$n(p)=1000-5p$ .If they charge S50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge 200$ per day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between 50$ per day and 200$ per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?

### Solution

Step 1: Let $P$ be the price charged per car per day and let $n$ be the number of cars rented per day. Let $R$ be the revenue per day.

Step 2: The problem is to maximize $k$

Step 3: The revenue (per day) is equal to the number of cars rented per day times the price charged per car per day—that is, R=nxp

Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function $n(p)=1000-5p$ ，the revenue $R$ can be represented by the function

R(p)=n×p=(1000-5p)p=-5p²+1000p

Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between 50$ per car per day and 200$ per car per day, the problem is to find the maximum revenue $R(p)$ for $p$ in the closed interval [50, 200]

Step 6:Since $R$ is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [50, 200], it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative is R'(p)=-10p+1000 .Therefore, the critical point is $p=100$ When $p=100$ R(100) = 50,000$ When $p= 50$, R(p) =  37, 500$ .When $p=200$ p =200 $p= 200$, R(p) =  0$ Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at p=100$ .The car rental company should charge 100$ per day per car to maximize revenue as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fxzPPgfstZSLzWZmpsNr0I0Xrr1b5oqBs.png)
maximize revenue. a car company has to

balance the price of a rental against the number of cars people will rent at that price.

4.34 A car rental company charges its customers $p$ dollars per day, where 60 ≤ p ≤ 150 It has found that the number of cars rented per day can be modeled by the linear function $n(p)=750-5p$ .How much should the company charge each customer to maximize revenue?

### Maximizing the Area of an Inscribed Rectangle

A rectangle is to be inscribed in the ellipse

x²/4+y²=1

What should the dimensions of the rectangle be to maximize its area? What is the maximum area?

### Solution

Step 1: For a rectangle to be inscribed in the ellipse. the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the axes. Let $L$ be the length of the rectangle and $W$ be its width. Let $A$ be the area of the rectangle

![](./images/fxyn2xZ4lwaDSqGW67Cqh33EfgeQCdOqb.png)
Figure 4.68We want to maximize the area of a rectangle inscribed in an

ellipse.

Step 2: The problem is to maximize $A$

Step 3: The area of the rectangle is $A=LW$

Step 4: Let $(x,y)$ be the cormer of the rectangle that lies in the first quadrant, as shown in Figure 4.68. We can write length $L=2x$ and width $W=2y$ Since x²/4+y²=1 and $y>0$ ，we have y =↑1 -x. Therefore the area is

A=LW=(2x)(2y)=4x√(1-x²/4)=2x√(4-x²)

Step 5: From Figure 4.68, we see that to inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the λ -coordinate of the corner in the first quadrant must satisfy $0<x<2$ Therefore, the problem reduces to looking for the maximum value of $A(x)$ over the open interval (0, 2). Since $A(x)$ will have an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over the closed interval [0, 2], we consider $A(x)=2x/4-x^{2}$ over the interval [0, 2]. If the absolute maximum occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the open interval.

Step 6: As mentioned earlier, $A(x)$ is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [O, 2]. Therefore, it has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum). At the endpoints $x=0$ and $x= 2$, $A( x) = 0$ .Fon $0< x< 2$, $A( x) > 0.$ A(x) > 0 $A(x)>0$ Therefore, the maximum must occur at a critical point. Taking the derivative of $A(x)$ we obtain

A'(x) = 2√(4 - x²) - 2x²/√(4 - x²) = (8 - 4x²)/√(4 - x²)

To find critical points.we need to find where A'(x) = 0 .We can see that if $X$ is a solution of

(8-4x²)/√(4-x²)=0,

then $X$ must satisfy

$$8-4x^{2}=0.$$

Therefore, $x^{2}=2$ .Thus, x=±√2 are the possible solutions of Equation 4.7. Since we are considering $X$ over the interval [0, 2], x=√2 is a possibility for a critical point, but x=-√2 is not. Therefore, we check whether ∛2 is a solution of Equation 4.7. Since x=√2 is a solution of Equation 4.7, we conclude that 
√2 is the only critical point of $A(x)$ in the interval [O, 2]. Therefore, $A(x)$ must have an absolute maximum at the critical point x=√2 .To determine the dimensions of the rectangle, we need to find the length $L$ and the width $W$ .If x=v'²/2 then

y = √(1 - (√2)²/4) = √(1 - 1/2) = 1/√2

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L=2x=2√2 and W = 2y = 2/√2 = √2 . The area of this rectangle is A = LW = (2√2)(√2) = 4

4.35 Modify the area function $A$ if therectangleis to be isribed inthe unit circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ .What is the domain of consideration?

# Solving Optimization Problems when the Interval Is Not Closed or Is Unbounded

In the previous examples, we considered functions on closed, bounded domains. Consequently, by the extreme value theorem, we were guaranteed that the functions had absolute extrema. Let‘s now consider functions for which the domain is neither closed nor bounded

Many functions still have at least one absolute extrema, even if the domain is not closed or the domain is unbounded. For example, the function $f(x)=x^{2}+4$ over (-∞), ∞ has an absolute minimum of 4 at $x=0$ .Therefore, we can still consider functions over unbounded domains or open intervals and determine whether they have any absolute extrema. In the next example, we try to minimize a function over an unbounded domain. We will see that, although the domain of consideration is (0, ∞ ,the function has an absolute minimum

In the following example, we look at constructing a box of least surface area with a prescribed volume. It is not difficult to show that for a closed-top box, by symmetry, among all boxes with a specified volume, a cube will have the smallest surface area. Consequently, we consider the modified problem of determining which open-topped box with a specified volume has the smallest surface area.

# Example 4.37

## Minimizing Surface Area

A rectangular box with a square base, an open top, and a volume of 216 in .3 is to be constructed. What should the dimensions of the box be to minimize the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area

### Solution

Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable $X$ to represent the length of each side of the square base; let $y$ represent the height of the box. Let $S$ denote the surface area of the open-top box

![](./images/fPrWdHiv7amZFvnKnssGfifBLqBu1OzUe.png)

Figure 4.69We want to minimize the surface area of a square-based box with a given volume.

Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize S

Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of the four vertical sides and the base The area of each of the four vertical sides is xy .The area of the base is $x^{2}$ .Therefore, the surface area of the box is

$$S=4xy+x^{2}.$$

Step 4: Since the volume of this box is $x^{2}y$ and the volume is given as 216 in.?, the constraint equation is

$$x^{2}y=216.$$

Solving the constraint equation for $y$, we have y = 216. Therefore, we can write the surface area as a function of $X$ only:

S(x)=4x(216/x²)+x²

Therefore,d S(x) = 864/x + x²

Step 5: Since we are requiring that $x^{2}y=216$ ，we cannot have $x=0$ .Therefore, we need $x>0$ .On the other hand, $x$ is allowed to have any positive value.Note that as $x$ becomes large,the height of the box $y$ becomes correspondingly small so that $x^{2}y=216$ .Similarly, as $x$ becomes small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0, ∞ .Note that unlike the previous examples.we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an absolute minimum over the interval (0, ∞)

Step 6: Note that as x→0⁺, S(x)→∞ .Also, as x→∞, S(x)→∞ .Since $S$ is a continuous functior

that approaches infinity at the ends, it must have an absolute minimum at some x∈(0, ∞ .This minimum mus occur at a critical point of $S$ The derivative is

S'(x)=-864/x²+2x

Therefore, S'(x) = 0 when 2x=864/x² .Solving this equation for $X$ ，we obtain $x^{3}=432$ ，so x = ∛432 = 6∛2 Since this is the only critical point of $S$ , the absolute minimum must occur at x=6∛2 (eFgure470) e x=6∛2, y= 216/(6³∛2)²=3∛2in . lefe eiesoesa t oastoe e x=6∛2in . and y=3∛2 in. With these dimensions, the surface area is

Figure 4.70We can use a graph to determine the dimensions

of a box of given the volume and the minimum surface area.

4.36 Consider the same open-top box, which is to have volume 216in .3. Suppose the cost of the material for the base is 20φ/in .2 and the cost of the material for the sides is 30φin .2 and we are trying to minimize the cost of this box. Write the cost as a function of the side lengths of the base. (Let $x$ be the side length of the base and $y$ be the height of the box.)

# 4.8 | L'Hopital's Rule

# Learning Objectives

4.8.1 Recognize when to apply L'Hopital's rule. 4.8.2 Identify indeterminate forms produced by quotients, products, subtractions, and powers, and apply L'Hopital's rule in each case 4.8.3 Describe the relative growth rates of functions

In this section,we examine a powerful tool for evaluating limits.This tool. known as L'Hopital’s rule.uses derivatives to calculate limits. With this rule, we will be able to evaluate many limits we have not yet been able to determine. Instead of relying on numerical evidence to conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to determine its exact value.

# Applying L'Hopital's Rule

L'Hopital's rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Conside

lim_(x→a)(f(x)/g(x))

If lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)=L₁ and lim_(x→a)g(x) = L₂≠0 ，then

lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x)=L₁/L₂.

However, what happens if lim_(x→a)f(x)=0 and lim_(x→a)g(x) = 0 ? We callthis one of the indeterminate forms, of type 0/0 This is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f(x)/g(x) as x → a withou further analvsis.We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example. conside

lim_(x→2)(x²-4)/(x-2) and lim_(x→0)sin x/x

For the first of these examples,we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing

lim<sub>x→2</sub>(x²-4)/(x-2)=lim<sub>x→2</sub>(x+2)(x-2)/(x-2)=lim<sub>x→2</sub>(x+2)=2+2=4

For lim_(x→0) sin x/x we were able to show, using a geometic argument, that

lim_(x→0)sin x/x=1.

Here we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to evaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could not calculate previously

The idea behind L'Hopital’s rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions $f$ and $g$ such that lim_(x→a)f(x)=0=lim_(x→a)g(x) and such that g'(a)≠0 For $X$ near $u$ ,we can write

f(x)≈f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)

and

g(x)≈g(a)+g'(a)(x-a)

Therefore,

f(x)/g(x) ≈ (f(a) + f'(a)(x - a))/(g(a) + g'(a)(x - a))

![](./images/fYZVGZbg7wXRsPV8vCsGXkhGo2uZ6nELN.png)
Figure 4.71 If lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)=lim<sub>x→a</sub>g(x) , then the ratio $f(x)/g(x)$ is

approximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.

Since $f$ is differentiable at $a$ ，then $f$ is continuous at $a$ ，and therefore f(a)=lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x)=0 .Similarly, g(a)=lim_g(x)= 0.If we also assume that f' and g' are continuous at $x=a$ thenfa=lim fx and g'(a) = lim_(x→a) g'(x) . Using these ideas, we conclude that

lim(x→a)f(x)/g(x) = lim(x→a)f'(x)(x-a)/g'(x)(x-a) = lim(x→a)f'(x)/g'(x).

Note that the assumption that f' and g' are continuous at $a$ and g'(a)≠0 can be loosened. We state L'Hopital’s rule formally for the indeterminate form 0/0 Also note that the notation 0/0 does not mean we are actually dividing zero by zero. Rather, we are using the notation 0/0 to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is zero.

### Theorem 4.12: L'Hopital's Rule (0/0 Case

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions over an open interval containing $a$ ，except possibly at $a$ .If 
limₓ→ₐf(x) = 0 and lim_(x→a)g(x) = 0 then

lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x)=lim_(x→a)f'(x)/g'(x),

assuming the limit on the right exists or is 00 or -∞0 .This result also holds if we are considering one-sided limits, or if $a=00$ and -∞

### Proof

We provide a proof of this theorem in the special case when $f$, $g$, f' ，and g' are all continuous over an open interval containing $a$ . In that case, since lim_(x→a)f(x) = 0 = lim_(x→a)g(x) and $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$ ，it follows that $f(a)=0=g(a)$ . Therefore

lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x) = lim_(x→a)(f(x)-f(a))/(g(x)-g(a)) since f(a)=0=g(a) = lim_(x→a)((f(x)-f(a))/(x-a))/((g(x)-g(a))/(x-a)) algebra = (lim_(x→a)(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a))/(lim_(x→a)(g(x)-g(a))/(x-a)) limit of a quotient = f′(a)/g′(a) definition of the derivative = (lim_(x→a)f′(x))/(lim_(x→a)g′(x)) continuity of f′ and g′ = lim_(x→a)f′(x)/g′(x). limit of a quotient

Note that L'Hopital's rule states we can calculate the limit of a quotient f/g by considering the limit of the quotient of the derivatives f'/g' It is important to realize that we are not calculating the derivative of the quotient f/g

### Example 4.38

Applying L'Hopital's Rule (0/o Case)

Evaluate each of the following limits by applying L'Hopital’s rule.

a. lim_(x→0)(1-cosx)/x b. lim_(x→1)(sin(πx))/ln x C.m d. 1imsinx-x

### Solution

a.Since the numerator 1 - cos x → 0 and the denominator  x→0  ,we can apply L'Hopital's rule to evaluate this limit. We have

lim_(x→0)(1-cos x)/x = lim_(x→0)sin x/1 = 0.

b.As x→1 ，the numerator sin(πx) → 0 and the denominator ln(x)→0 .Therefore, we can apply L'Hopital's rule. We obtain

limₓ→₁ sin(πx)/ln x = limₓ→₁ (πcos(πx))/(1/x) = limₓ→₁ (πx)cos(πx) = (π·1)(-1) = -π

C.As x→∞ ，the numerator e¹ˣ - 1 → 0 and the denominator (]→0.Therefore,we can appl L'Hopital's rule. We obtain

limₓ→∞ (e^(1/x) - 1)/(1/x) = limₓ→∞ (e^(1/x)(-1/x²))/(-1/x²) = limₓ→∞ e^(1/x) = e⁰ = 1

d.As  x→0  ，both the numerator and denominator approach zero. Therefore, we can apply L'Hopital’s rule. We obtain

lim_(x→0)(sin x - x)/x² = lim_(x→0)(cos x - 1)/2x

 Since the numerator and denominator of this new quotient both approach zero as  x→0  weapply L'Hopital’s rule again. In doing so, we see that

lim_(x→0)(cosx-1)/(2x)=lim_(x→0)(-sinx)/2=0.

Therefore, we conclude that

lim_(x→0) (sin x - x)/x² = 0

# 4.37 Evaluate lim_(x→0)(x/tan x)

We can also use L'Hopital's ruleto evaluate limits of quotients f(x)/g(x) in which f(x)→±∞ and g(x)→±∞ . Limits of this form are classified as indeterminate forms of type oo/oo. Again, note that we are not actually dividing ∞ by ∞ Since ∞0 is not a real number, that is impossible; rather, ∞/∞ .is used to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is ∞ or -∞

## Theorem 4.13: L'Hopital's Rule 00/∞0 Case)

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions over an open interval containing $a$ ，except possibly at $d$ Suppose lim_f(x)= ∞o (or -∞ )and lim_g(x)=oo (or -∞ ).Then

lim_(x→a)f(x)/g(x)=lim_(x→a)f'(x)/g'(x),

assuming the limit on the right exists or is 00 or -∞0 .This result also holds if the limit is infinite, if a=∞ or

# Example 4.39

## Applying L'Hopital's Rule (co/co Case

Evaluate each of the following limits by applying L'Hopital’s rule.

a. lim<sub>x→∞</sub>(3x+5)/(2x+1)  b. lim<sub>x→0⁺</sub>(lnx/cotx)

### Solution

a.Since $3x+5$ and $2x+1$ are first-degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients, lim(x→∞)(3x+5)=∞ and limₓ→∞(2x + 1) = ∞ .Therefore, we apply LHopital's rule and obtain

lim_(x→∞)(3x+5)/(2x+1/x)=lim_(x→∞)3/2=3/2

Note that this limit can also be calculated without invoking L'Hopital's rule. Earlier in the chapter we showed how to evaluate such a limit by dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $X$ in the denominator. In doing so,we saw that

lim(x→∞)(3x+5)/(2x+1) = lim(x→∞)(3+5/x)/(2+1/x) = 3/2

L'Hopital's rule provides us with an alternative means of evaluating this type of limit

b. Here, limₓ→₀⁺ln x=-∞ and lim_(x→0⁺)cot x = ∞ .Therefore, we can aly Hpitals ule and obtain

lim_(x→0⁺) (lnx)/(cotx) = lim_(x→0⁺) 1/x/(-csc²x) = lim_(x→0⁺) 1/(-xcsc²x)

Now as x→0⁺, csc²x → ∞ Therefore, the first term in the denominator is approaching zero and the second term is getting really large. In such a case, anything can happen with the product. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusion yet. To evaluate the limit, we use the definition of csc x towrite

lim_(x→0⁺)1/(-xcsc²x) = lim_(x→0⁺)sin²x/-x

Now lim_(x→0⁺)sin²x=0 and lim<sub>x→0⁺</sub> x = 0 so we apply I'Hopital' ule again. We find

lim_(x→0⁺)sin²x/(-x)=lim_(x→0⁺)2sin x cos x/(-1)=0/(-1)=0.

We conclude that

lim_(x→0⁺) (ln x)/(cot x) = 0

As mentioned, L'Hopital’s rule is an extremely useful tool for evaluating limits. It is important to remember, however, that to apply L'Hopitl'srule to a quotient f(x)/g(x) .it is essential that the limit of f(x)/g(x) be of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞ . Consider the following example

### Example 4.40

When L'Hopital's Rule Does Not Apply

Consider lim_(x→1) (x² + 5)/(3x + 4) Show thath limi cano e evluaedby aplying L Hopital' sulet

### Solution

Because the limits of the numerator and denominator are not both zero and are not both infinite, we cannot apply L'Hopital's rule. If we try to do so, we get

d/dx(x² + 5) = 2x

and

d/dx(3x+4) = 3

At which point we would conclude erroneously that

limₓ→₁ (x²+5)/(3x+4)=limₓ→₁ 2x/3=2/3.

However, since lim_(x→1)(x²+5)=6 and limₓ→₁ (3x+4)=7 weactully have

limₓ→₁ (x²+5)/(3x+4)=6/7.

We can conclude that

lim_(x→1)(x²+5)/(3x+4)≠lim_(x→1)(d/dx(x²+5))/(d/dx(3x+4)).

### Other Indeterminate Forms

L'Hopital's ruleis very useful for evaluating limits involving the indeterminate forms 0/0 and ∞/∞ .However, we can also use L'Hopital’s rule to help evaluate limits involving other indeterminate forms that arise when evaluating limits.The expressions 0*∞ ， ∞-∞ ， 1^∞ ， ∞⁰ ，and $0^0$ are all considered indeterminate forms. These expressions are not real numbers. Rather, they represent forms that arise when trying to evaluate certain limits. Next we realize why these are indeterminate forms and then understand how to use L'Hopital's rule in these cases. The key idea is that we must rewrite

the indeterminate forms in such a way that we arrive at the indeterminate form or ∞/∞

### Indeterminate Form of Type 0.cc

Suppose we want to evaluate lim_(x→a)(f(x)⋅g(x)) ，where f(x)→0 and g(x)→∞ (or -∞ )as X → u .Since one term in the product is approaching zero but the other term is becoming arbitrarily large (in magnitude), anything can happen to the product. We use the notation 0*∞ to denote the form that arises in this situation. The expression 0*∞ is considered indeterminate because we cannot determine without further analysis the exact behavior of the product $f(x)g(x)$ as x → a For example, let 71 be a positive integer and consider

f(x) = 1/(xⁿ + 1) and g(x) = 3x²

As x→∞0 x → 0 x→∞, f(x)→0 and g(x)→∞ . However, the limit as X→00 of f(x)g(x) = ~3+ varies, depending on $Tr$ If $n=2$ ，then limₓ→∞ f(x)g(x)=3 .If $n=1$ ，then lim_(x→∞)f(x)g(x)=∞ . If $n=3$ ，then lim<sub>x→∞</sub>f(x)g(x)=0 .Here we consider another limit involving the indeterminate form 0*∞ and show how to rewrite the function as a quotient to use L'Hopital's rule

## Example 4.41

Indeterminate Form of Type 0*∞

Evaluate lim, In x.

## Solution

First, rewrite the function xlnx as a quotient to apply L'Hopital’s rule. If we write

xln x = (ln x)/(1/x)

we see that 
ln x → -∞  as x→0⁺ and 1/x → ∞ as x→0⁺ .Therefore, we can apply L'Hopital’s rule and obtain

lim_(x→0⁺)(ln x)/(1/x) = lim_(x→0⁺)(d/dx(ln x))/(d/dx(1/x)) = lim_(x→0⁺)(1/x)/(-1/x²) = lim_(x→0⁺)(-x) = 0.

We conclude that

limₓ→₀⁺ x ln x = 0.

4.40 Evaluate lim_(x→0)xcot x

### Indeterminate Form of Type ∞-∞

Another type of indeterminate form is ∞-∞ .Consider the following example. Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $f(x)=3x^{n}$ and $g(x)=3x^{2}+5$ .As x→∞, f(x)→∞ and g(x)→∞ . We are interested in lim_(x→∞)(f(x)-g(x)) Depending on whether $f(x)$ grows faster, $g(x)$ grows faster, or they grow at the same rate, as we see next, anything car happen in this limit. Since f(x)→∞ and g(x)→∞ ，we write ∞-∞ to denote the form of this limit.As with our other indeterminate forms, ∞-∞ has no meaning on its own and we must do more analysis to determine the value of the limit.For example, suppose the exponent 72 in the function $f(x)=3x^{n}$ is $n=3$ ，then

lim_(x→∞)(f(x)-g(x)) = lim_(x→∞)(3x³-3x²-5) = ∞

On the other hand, if $n=2$ ，then


lim_(x→∞)(f(x) - g(x)) = lim_(x→∞)(3x² - 3x² - 5) = -5

However, if $n=1$ ，then

lim(x→∞)(f(x)-g(x))=lim(x→∞)(3x-3x²-5)=-∞

Therefore, the limit cannot be determined by considering only ∞-∞ . Next we see how to rewrite an expression involving the indeterminate form ∞-∞ as a fraction to apply L'Hopital’s rule.

# Example 4.42

Indeterminate Form of Type ∞-∞

Evalute Lin,( - alx)

### Solution

By combining the fractions, we can write the function as a quotient. Since the least common denominator is f''(x)<0 wehave

(tan x)-x²/(x²tan x)

As x→0⁺ ，the numerator tan x - x² → 0 and the denominator x²tan x → 0 .Therefore, we can apply L'Hopital's rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we have

lim_(x→0⁺)(tan x-x²)/(x²tan x)=lim_(x→0⁺)(sec²x-2x)/(x²sec²x+2xtan x).

As x→0⁺, (sec²x)-2x→1 and x²sec²x + 2x tan x → 0 .Since the denominator is positive as $x$ approaches zero from the right, we conclude that

lim_(x→0⁺)((sec²x)-2x)/(x²sec²x+2x tan x)=∞

Therefore,

lim_(x→0⁺)(1/x² - 1/tan x) = ∞.

![](./images/fM3mG8Z6k1i8RseC4bZcU0sBGpNxk8OAc.png)

4.41Evaluate lim(-sin.x)

Another type of indeterminate form that arises when evaluating limits involves exponents. The expressions $0^0$, ∞⁰ ，and 1^∞ are all indeterminate forms. On their own, these expressions are meaningless because we cannot actually evaluate these expressions as we would evaluate an expression involving real numbers. Rather, these expressions represent forms that arise when finding limits. Now we examine how L'Hopital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving these indeterminate forms.

Since L'Hopital’s rule applies to quotients,we use the natural logarithm function and its properties to reduce a problem evaluating a limit involving exponents to a related problem involving a limit of a quotient. For example, suppose we want to evaluate limₓ→ₐf(x)ᵍ⁽ˣ⁾ and we arrive at the indeterminate form ∞⁰ . (The indeterminate forms) $0^{0}$ and 1^∞ can be handled similarly,) We proceed as follows. Let

$$y=f(x)^{g(x)}.$$

Then,

ln y=ln(f(x)ᵍ⁽ˣ⁾)=g(x)ln(f(x))

Therefore,

limₓ→ₐ[ln(y)]=limₓ→ₐ[g(x)ln(f(x))].

Since lim_(x→a)f(x)=∞ ，we know that lim┬(x→a)⁡ln(f(x)) = ∞ . Therefore, lim<sub>x→a</sub>g(x)ln(f(x)) is of the indeterminate form

0*∞ ，and we can use the techniques discussed earlier to rewrite the expression g(x)ln(f(x)) in a form so that we can apply L'Hopital's rule. Suppose lim_(x→a) g(x)ln(f(x)) = L, where $L$ may be ∞0 or -∞ .Then

lim_(x→a)[ln(y)] = L

Since the natural logarithm function is continuous, we conclude that

ln(lim_(x→a) y) = L

which gives us

limx→a y = limx→a f(x)g(x) = e^L

### Example 4.43

Indeterminate Form of Type 

Evaluate lim_(x→∞) x^(1/x)

### Solution

Let $y=x^{1/x}$ Then,

ln(x¹ˣ) = (1/x)lnx = (lnx)/x.

We need to evaluate lim(x→∞) ln x / x Applying L'Hopital's rule, we obtain

lim_(x→∞) ln y = lim_(x→∞) (ln x)/x = lim_(x→∞) (1/x)/1 = 0

Therefore, limₓ→∞ln y = 0 . Since the natural logarithm function is continuous, we conclude that

ln(lim(x→∞)y)=0,

which leads to

lim_(x→∞)y=lim_(x→∞)(ln x)/x=e⁰=1

Hence,

lim_(x→∞)x^(1/x)=1

![](./images/fMSlSqIwrMpgSbnVP3wmAOxznmbOSowhc.png)

4.42 Evaluate lim_(x→∞)x^(1/ln(x))

## Example 4.44

## Indeterminate Form of Type. $0^{0}$

Evaluate lim+ xsi t

### Solution

Let

y=x<sup>sin x</sup>

Therefore,

ln y=ln(x<sup>sin x</sup>)=sin x ln x

Wenow evaluate lim sinxlmx. Since lim_(x→0⁺)sin x = 0 and limₓ→₀⁺ln x=-∞ we have the indetermiate form 0*∞ .To apply L'Hopital’s rule, we need to rewrite sin.xln.x as a fraction. We could write

sin x ln x = sin x / (1/ln x)

or

sin x ln x = (ln x)/(1/sin x) = (ln x)/csc x.

Let's consider the first option, In this case, applving L'Hopital's rule, we would obtain

lim(x→0⁺)sin x ln x=lim(x→0⁺)sinx/(1/ln x)=lim(x→0⁺)cosx/(-1/(x(ln x)²))=lim(x→0⁺)-x(ln x)²cos x

Unfortunately, we not only have another expression involving the indeterminate form 0*∞ but the new limit is even more complicated to evaluate than the one with which we started. Instead, we try the second option. By writing

sin x ln x = ln x / (1/sin x) = ln x / csc x

and applying L'Hopital’s rule, we obtain

lim(x→0⁺) sin x ln x = lim(x→0⁺) ln x / csc x = lim(x→0⁺) 1/x / (-csc x cot x) = lim(x→0⁺) -1 / (x csc x cot x)

Using the fact that csc x=1/sin x and cotx=cosx/sinx .we can rewrite the expression on the right-hand side a

lim_(x→0⁺)-sin²x/(x cos x)=lim_(x→0⁺)[(sin x/x)(-tan x)]=(lim_(x→0⁺)sin x/x)(lim_(x→0⁺)(-tan x))=1·0=0

We cocldethat lim_(x→0⁺)ln y = 0 . Therefore, ln(lim_(x→0⁺)y)=0 and we ave

lim_(x→0⁺)y=lim_(x→0⁺)x^(sinx)=e⁰=1.

Hence,

lim_(x→0⁺) x^(sin x) = 1

4.43 Evaluate lim_(ε→0⁺)xˣ

## Growth Rates of Functions

Suppose the functions $f$ and $g$ both approach infinity as x→∞ .Although the values of both functions become arbitrarily large as the values of $x$ become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the other. For example, $f(x)=x^{2}$ and $g(x)=x^3$ both approach infinity as x→∞ .However, as shown in the following table, the values of $x^3$ are growing much faster than the values of $x^2$


x|10|100|1000|10,000
$f(x)=x^{2}$|100|10,000|1,000,000|100,000,000

Table 4.7 Comparing the Growth Rates of $x^2$ and $x^3$

In fact,

lim(x→∞) x³/x² = lim(x→∞) x = ∞. or, equivalently, lim(x→∞) x²/x³ = lim(x→∞) 1/x = 0

As a result, we say $x^3$ is growing more rapidly than $x^2$ as x→∞ .On the other hand, for $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=3x^{2}+4x+1$ ，although the values of $g(x)$ are always greater than the values of $f(x)$ for $x>0$ ，each value of $g(x)$ is roughly three times the corresponding value of $f(x)$ as x→∞ ,as shown in the following table. In fact,

lim_(x→∞) x²/ (3x²+4x+1) = 1/3.


x|10|100|1000|10,000
$f(x)=x^{2}$|100|10,000|1,000,000|100,000,000

Table 4.8 Comparing the Growth Rates of $x^2$ and $3x^{2}+4x+1$

In this case, we say that $x^2$ and $3x^{2}+4x+1$ are growing at the same rate as x→∞

More generally, suppose $f$ and $g$ are two functions that approach infinity as x→∞ .We say $g$ grows more rapidly than $f$ as x→∞ if

limₓ→∞g(x)/f(x)=∞; or, equivalently, limₓ→∞f(x)/g(x)=0

On the other hand, if there exists a constant M ≠ 0 such that

lim_(x→∞)f(x)/g(x)=M

we say $f$ and $g$ grow at the same rate as X→00

16) f(x) = ln(x) and $g(x)=x^{2}$

### Solution

a. Since lim_(x→∞)x²=∞ and lim_(x→∞)eˣ=∞ .we can use LHpitals rule to evaluate lim_(x→∞)[x²/eˣ] W obtain

lim<sub>x→∞</sub>x²/eˣ = lim<sub>x→∞</sub>2x/eˣ

Since lim_(x→∞)2x=∞ and lim_(x→∞)eˣ = ∞ ,we can apply L'Hopital's rule again. Sinc

limₓ→∞(2x/eˣ)=limₓ→∞(2/eˣ)=0,

we conclude that

lim_(x→∞)x²/eˣ = 0

Therefore, $e^{x}$ grows more rapidly than $x^{2}$ as x→∞ (See Figure 4.73and Table 4.9)

b. Since lim_(x→∞)ln x = ∞ and lim_(x→∞)x²=∞ ,we can use L'Hopital's rule to evaluate lim . We obtain

lim_(x→∞)(ln x)/x² = lim_(x→∞)(1/x)/(2x) = lim_(x→∞)1/(2x²) = 0.

Thus, $x^{2}$ grows more rapidly than ln x as X→ℂ (see Figure 4.74 and Table 4.10)

4.9.1 Describe the steps of Newton's method. 4.9.2 Explain what an iterative process means. 4.9.3 Recognize when Newton’s method does not work. 4.9.4 Apply iterative processes to various situations

In many areas of pure and applied mathematics, we are interested in finding solutions to an equation of the form $f(x)=0$ For most functions, however, it is difficult—if not impossible—to calculate their zeroes explicitly. In this section, we take a look at a technique that provides a very efficient way of approximating the zeroes of functions. This technique makes use of tangent line approximations and is behind the method used often by calculators and computers to find zeroes.

## Describing Newton's Method.

Consider the task of finding the solutions of $f(x)=0$ 1.If $f$ is the first-degree polynomial $f(x)=ax+b$ ，then the solution of $f(x)=0$ is given by the formula x=−b/a If $f$ is the second-degree polynomial $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$ the solutions of $f(x)=0$ can be found by using the quadratic formula. However, for polynomials of degree 3 or more, finding roots of $f$ becomes more complicated. Although formulas exist for third- and fourth-degree polynomials, they are quite complicated. Also, if $f$ is a polynomial of degree 5 or greater, it is known that no such formulas exist. For example, consider the function

$$f(x)=x^5+8x^4+4x^3-2x-7.$$

No formula exists that allows us to find the solutions of $f(x)=0$ . Similar difficulties exist for nonpolynomial functions. For example, consider the task of finding solutions of tan(x)-x=0 .No simple formula exists for the solutions of this equation. In cases such as these, we can use Newton’s method to approximate the roots.

Newton’s method makes use of the following idea to approximate the solutions of $f(x)=0$ .By sketching a graph of $f$ ，we can estimate a root of $f(x)=0$ Let's call this estimate 
2) 𝒬₀ .We then draw the tangent line to $f$ at λ₀ If f'(x₀)≠0 , this tangent line intersects the $A$ -axis at some point (x1 $(x_{1}$ $(x_{1},0).$ Now let $x_1$ be the next approximation to the actual root. Typically, λ₁ is closer than ℒ₀ to an actual root. Next we draw the tangent line to $f$ at λ₁ . If f'(x₁)≠0 this tangent line also intersects the $X$ -axis, producing another approximation, $x_{2}$ . We continue in this way, deriving a list of approximations: x0 $X_{0}$ $A1$ X1 $x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},.$ ... Typically, the numbers $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, … quickly approach an actual root x<sup>非</sup> ， as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fMgSWq3mQYuas6YKV08OU08BZLpQqVyWU.png)
Figure 4.77 The approximations $x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2, .$ X2 $x_2$ . aproach the actual root $x^{*}$ .The

approximations are derived by looking at tangent lines to the graph of $f$

Now let's look at how to calculate the approximations $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, … If $x_0$ is our first approximation, the approximation $X1$ is defined by letting $(x_1,0)$ bethe $X$ -intercept of the tangent line to $f$ at $X_{0}$ . The equation of this tangent line is given by

$$y=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0).$$

Therefore, $X_{1}$ must satisfy

$$f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x_1-x_0)=0.$$

Solving this equation for $x_{1}$ ，we conclude that

x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀)

Similarly, the point $(x_2,0)$ is the $X$ -intercept of the tangent line to $f$ at $x_{1}$ .Therefore, $x_{2}$ satisfies the equation

x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁)/f'(x₁)

In general, for $n>0$ ， $X_{n}$ satisfies

xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - f(xₙ₋₁)/f'(xₙ₋₁)

Next we see how to make use of this technique to approximate the root of the polynomial $f(x)=x^{3}-3x+1$

### Example 4.46

### Finding a Root of a Polynomial

Use Newton’'s method to approximate a root of $f(x)=x^{3}-3x+1$ in the interval [1, 2]. Let $x_{0}=2$ and find $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$ X4 $x_4$ ，and $X5$

### Solution

From Figure 4.78, we see that $f$ has one root over the interval (1, 2). Therefore $x_{0}=2$ seems like a reasonable first approximation. To find the next approximation, we use Equation 4.8. Since $f(x)=x^{3}-3x+1$ ，the derivative is f'(x)=3x²-3 .Using Equation 4.8 with $n=1$ (and a calculator that displays 10 digits),we obtain

x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀) = 2 - f(2)/f'(2) = 2 - 3/9 ≈ 1.666666667

To find the next approximation, $x_{2}$ ，we use Equation 4.8 with $n=2$ and the value of $x_{1}$ stored on the calculator. We find that

x₂=x₁=f(x₁)/f′(x₁)≈1.548611111

Continuing in this way, we obtain the following results:

x₁≈1.666666667 x₂ ≈ 1.54861111 x₃≈1.532390162 x₄≈1.532088989 x 1.53208888661.532088886.

We note that we obtained the same value for λ5 and $x_{6}$ .Therefore, any subsequent application of Newton' method will most likely give the same value for $X_{n}$

![](./images/fNgSUbYDOf0ZlY5pYMyWXwrwgBRw3F0oB.png)
Figure 4.78 The function $f(x)=x^{3}-3x+1$ has one root

over the interval [1, 2]

4.45 Letting $x_{0}=0$ let's use Newton's method to approximate the root of $f(x)=x^{3}-3x+1$ over the interval [0, 1] by calculating $x_1$ and $x_2$

Newton’s method can also be used to approximate square roots. Here we show how to approximate √12 This method can be modified to approximate the square root of any positive number.

### Example 4.47

## Finding aSquare Root

Use Newton's method to approximate √2 (Figure 4.79). Let $f(x)=x^{2}-2$ ，let $x_{0}=2$ ，and calculate x1 $x_{1}$ $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$ (We note that since $f(x)=x^{2}-2$ has a zero at √2 the initial value $x_{0}=2$ is a reasonable choice to approximate 2^(1/4) )

### Solution

For $f(x)=x^{2}-2$ f'(x)=2x .From Equation 4.8,we know tha

xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - f(xₙ₋₁)/f'(xₙ₋₁) = xₙ₋₁ - (x²ₙ₋₁ - 2)/(2xₙ₋₁) = 1/2xₙ₋₁ + 1/xₙ₋₁ = 1/2(xₙ₋₁ + 2/xₙ₋₁)

Therefore,

x₁=(1/2)(x₀+2/x₀)=(1/2)(2+2/2)=1.5; x₂=(1/2)(x₁+2/x₁)=(1/2)(1.5+2/1.5)≈1.416666667

Continuing in this way, we find that

x₁=1.5, x₂≈1.416666667, x₃≈1.414215686, x₄≈1.414213562, x₅≈1.414213562

Since we obtained the same value for $x_4$ and $x_5$ , it is unlikely that the value $x_n$ will change on any subsequent application of Newton's method. We conclude that √2 ≈ 1.414213562

![](./images/fHP6sb8xDZXL0yFZd1NHEgineZ2u5D57d.png)
Figure 4.79 We can use Newton’s method to find √2

![](./images/fie7S0oly7blaB2lVxMQRn2F9X4Lg5u94.png)

4.46Use Newton's method to approximate √3 by letting $f(x)=x^{2}-3$ and $x_{0}=3$ . Find $x_1$ and $x_{2}$

When using Newton’s method, each approximation after the initial guess is defined in terms of the previous approximatior by using the same formula. In prticular, by defining the function F(x)=x-[f(x)/f'(x)] we can rewrite Equation 4.8 as $x_{n}=F(x_{n-1})$ .This type of process, where each $X_{n}$ is defined in terms of $x_{n-1}$ by repeating the same function, is an example of an iterative process. Shortly, we examine other iterative processes. First, let's look at the reasons why Newton’s method could fail to find a root

## Failures of Newton's Method

Typically, Newton’s method is used to find roots fairly quickly. However, things can go wrong. Some reasons why Newton's method might fail include the following

1. At one of the approximations $x_n$ ，the derivative f' is zero at $X_{n}$ but f(xₙ)≠0 .As a result, the tangent line of $f$ at $X_{n}$ does not intersect the $X$ -axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the iterative process. 2. The approximations $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, … may approach a different root. If the function $f$ has more than one root, it is possible that our approximations do not approach the one for which we are looking, but approach a different root (see Figure 4.80). This event most often occurs when we do not choose the approximation $X_{0}$ close enough to the desired root 3.The approximations may fail to approach a root entirely. In Example 4.48, we provide an example of a function and an initial guess $x_0$ such that the successive approximations never approach a root because the successive approximations continue to altermate back and forthbetween two values

![](./images/fOMC7AKkyNxGED1DNXpEhtZgdZ4Tg0Px5.png)

Figure 4.80 If the initial guess $x_0$ is too far from the root sought, it may lead to approximations that approach a different root.

## Example 4.48

### When Newton's Method Fails

Consider the function $f(x)=x^{3}-2x+2$ . Let $x_{0}=0$ .Show that the sequence x₁, x₂, … fails to approach a root of $f$

### Solution

For $f(x)=x^{3}-2x+2$ ， the derivative is f'(x)=3x²-2 . Therefore

x₁=x₀-f(x₀)/f'(x₀)=0-f(0)/f'(0)=-2/-2=1

In the next step,

x₂=x₁-f(x₁)/f′(x₁)=1-f(1)/f′(1)=1-1/1=0.

Consequently, the numberse $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, … continue to bounce back and forth between O and 1 and never get closer to the root of $f$ which is over the interval [2, 1] (see Figure 4.81). Fortunately, if we choose an initial approximation $X_{0}$ closer to the actual root, we can avoid this situation.

![](./images/fYq7GMDzv0zUldFHvGowXdpi1gZrxwH4c.png)
Figure 4.81 The approximations continue to alternate

between O and 1 and never approach the root of $f$

![](./images/fsQoa86OGvvZsCFdttFkeqZzWLQoSYAEW.png)

4.47 For $f(x)=x^{3}-2x+2$ ，let $x_{0}=-1.5$ and find $x_1$ and $x_2$

From Example 4.48, we see that Newton's method does not always work. However, when it does work, the sequence of approximations approaches the root very quickly. Discussions of how quickly the sequence of approximations approach a root found using Newton's method are included in texts on numerical analysis.

## Other Iterative Processes

As mentioned earlier, Newton’s method is a type of iterative process. We now look at an example of a different type of iterative process.

Consider a function $F$ and an initial number $x_0$ Define the subsequent numbers $x_n$ by the formula $x_{n}=F(x_{n-1})$ .This process is an iterative process that creates a list of numbers x2 $x_2$ $x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2, . . .$, xₙ, … Xn $x_n$ .This list of numbers may approach a finite number $x^{-1}$ as $n$ gets larger, or it may not. In Example 4.49, we see an example of a function $F$ and an initial guess $x_0$ such that the resulting list of numbers approaches a finite value.

## Example 4.49

## Finding a Limit for an Iterative Process

Let F(x) = (1/2)x + 4 and let $x_{0}=0$ . For all n ≥ 1 ，let $x_{n}=F(x_{n-1})$ . Find the values $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$ Make a conjecture about what happens to this list of numbers $x_1$, $x_2$, x₃…, xₙ, … as n→∞ . If the list of numbers x2 $x_{2}$ $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, x₃, … approaches a finite number $x^{*}$ ，then $x^{20}$ satisfies $x^{*}=F(x^{*})$ ，and x<sup>非</sup> is called a fixed point of $F$

## Solution

If $x_{0}=0$ ，then

![](./images/fWRxE0rsLz06OiaDM5VaCUMcRstOX5zw8.png)

From this list, we conjecture that the values $x_n$ approach 8

Figure 4.82 provides a graphical argument that the values approach 8 as n→∞ .Starting at the point $( x_0$, $x_0)$ ,we draw a vertical line to the point $( x_0$, $F( x_0) )$ . The next number in our list is $x_{1}=F(x_{0})$ .We use $x_1$ to calculate $x_2$ . Therefore, we draw a horizontal line connecting $( x_0$, $x_1)$ to the point $( x_1$, $x_1)$ on the line $y=x$ ,and then draw a vertical line connecting $(x_1,x_1)$ to the point $(x_{1},F(x_{1})).$ The output $F(x_{1})$ becomes $x_2$ Continuing in this way, we could create an infinite number of line segments. These line segments are trapped between the lines F(x)=x/2+4 and $y=x$ . The line segments get closer to the intersection point of these two lines, which occurs when $x=F(x)$ .Solving the equation x =+ 4,we conclude they intersect at $x=8$ Therefore, our graphical evidence agrees with our numerical evidence that the list of numbers $x_{0}$, $x_{1}$, x₂, … approaches $x^{*}=8$ as 
n → 0

$x^{*}=8$

$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$ Make a conjecture about what happens to the list of numbers $x_1$, $x_2$, x₃, … xₙ , … as n→∞

### Iterative Processes and Chaos

Iterative processes can yield some very interesting behavior. In this section, we have seen several examples of iterative processes that converge to a fixed point. We also saw in Example 4.48 that the iterative process bounced back and forth between two values. We call this kind of behavior a 2 -cycle. Iterative processes can converge to cycles with various periodicities, such as 2- cycles, 4 - cycles (where the iterative process repeats a sequence of four values),

8-cycles, and so on.

Some iterative processes yield what mathematicians call chaos. In this case, the iterative process jumps from value to value in a seemingly random fashion and never converges or settles into a cycle. Although a complete exploration of chaos is beyond the scope of this text, in this project we look at one of the key properties of a chaotic iterative process: sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This property refers to the concept that small changes in initial conditions can generate drastically different behavior in the iterative process

Probably the best-known example of chaos is the Mandelbrot set (see Figure 4.83), named after Benoit Mandelbrot (19242010), who investigated its properties and helped popularize the field of chaos theory. The Mandelbrot set is usually generated by computer and shows fascinating details on enlargement, including self-replication of the set. Several colorized versions of the set have been shown in museums and can be found online and in popular books on the subject.

![](./images/fSwmAS1SS9zArTZ10n7Lly89ygGiXWin6.png)
Figure 4.83The Mandelbrot set is a well-known example of a set of points generated by the

iterative chaotic behavior of a relatively simple function.

In this project we use the logistic map

f(x)=rx(1-x), where x∈[0, 1] and r>0

as the function in our iterative process. The logistic map is a deceptively simple function; but, depending on the value of $r$ ,the resulting iterative process displays some very interesting behavior. It can lead to fixed points, cycles, and even chaos.

To visualize the long-term behavior of the iterative process associated with the logistic map, we will use a tool called a cobweb diaqram.As we did with the iterative process we examined earlierin this section.we first draw a vertical line from the point $(x_0,0)$ to the point $(x_{0},f(x_{0}))=(x_{0},x_{1})$ .We then draw a horizontal line from that point to the point $(x_1,x_1)$ , then draw a vertical line to $(x_{1},f(x_{1}))=(x_{1},x_{2})$ ,and continue the process until the long-term behavior of the system becomes apparent.Figure 4.84 shows the long-term behavior of the logistic map when $r=3.55$ and $x_{0}=0.2$ . (The first 100 iterations are not plotted.) The long-term behavior of this iterative process is an 8 -cycle

![](./images/fYWPBY7PManZBTcB0yI38GopWx0pqSxr4.png)
Figure 4.84A cobweb diagram for $f(x)=3.55x(1-x)$ is

presented here. The sequence of values results in an 8 -cycle.

1.Let $r=0.5$ and choose $x_{0}=0.2$ .Either by hand or by using a computer,calculate the first10 values in the sequence. Does the sequence appear to converge? If so, to what value? Does it result in a cycle? If so, what kind of cycle(for example, 2- cycle, 4- cycle.)?

2.What happens when $r=2$ ？

3.For $r=3.2$ and $r=3.5$ ，calculate the first 100 sequence values. Generate a cobweb diagram for each iterative process. (Several free applets are available online that generate cobweb diagrams for the logistic map.) What is the long-term behavior in each of these cases? 4. Now let $r=4$ Calculate the first100 sequence values and generate a cobweb diagram.What is the long term behavior in this case? 5.Repeat the process for $r=4$ ，but let $x_{0}=0.201$ .How does this behavior compare with the behavior for
$$x_{0}=0.2?$$

4.10.1Find the general antiderivative of a given function.

4.10.2Explain the terms and notation used for an indefinite integral 4.10.3State the power rule for integrals. 4.10.4 Use antidifferentiation to solve simple initial-value problems.

At this point, we have seen how to calculate derivatives of many functions and have been introduced to a variety of their applications. We now ask a question that turns this process around: Given a function $f$ how do we find a function with the derivative $f$ and why would we be interested in such a function?

We answer the first part of this question by defining antiderivatives. The antiderivative of a function $f$ is a function with a derivative $f$ .Why are we interested in antiderivatives? The need for antiderivatives arises in many situations, and we look at various examples throughout the remainder of the text. Here we examine one specific example that involves rectilinear motion. In our examination in Derivatives of rectilinear motion, we showed that given a position function $s(t)$ of an object, then its velocity function ν(t) is the derivative of $s(t)$ —that is, ν(t) = s'(t) . Furthermore, the acceleration $a(t)$ is the derivative of the velocity ν(t) —that is, 
a(t)=v'(t)=s''(t) .Now suppose we are given an acceleration function $a$ ，but not the velocity function $v$ or the position function S .Since a(t)=ν'(t) ,determining the velocity function requires us to find an antiderivative of the acceleration function. Then, since ν(t) = s'(t) determining the position function requires us to find an antiderivative of the velocity function. Rectilinear motion is just one case in which the need for antiderivatives arises. We will see many more examples throughout the remainder of the text. For now, let's look at the terminology and notation for antiderivatives, and determine the antiderivatives for several types of functions. We examine various techniques for finding antiderivatives of more complicated functions later in the text (lntroduction to Techniques of Integration (http:l/cnx.org/content/m53654/latest/) )

# The Reverse of Differentiation

At this point, we know how to find derivatives of various functions. We now ask the opposite question. Given a function $f$ ,how can we find a function with derivative $f$ ? If we can find a function $F$ derivative $f$ ,we call $F$ an antiderivative of $f$

### Definition

A function $F$ is an antiderivative of the function $f$ if

F'(x)=f(x)

for all $X$ in the domain of $f$

Consider the function $f(x)=2x$ Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that $F(x)=x^{2}$ is an antiderivative of $f$ since F'(x)=2x .Are there any other antiderivatives of $f$ ?Yes; since the derivative of any constant L is zero, $x^{2}+C$ is also an antiderivative of $2x$ . Therefore, $x^{2}+5$ and x² - √2 are also antiderivatives. Are there any others that are not of the form $x^{2}+C$ for some constant $C$ ? The answer is no. From Corollary 2 of the Mean Value Theorem, we know that if $F$ and $G$ are differentiable functions such that F'(x) = G'(x) ，then $F(x)-G(x)=C$ for some constant C .This fact leads to the following important theorem.

## Theorem 4.14: General Form of an Antiderivative

Let $F$ be an antiderivative of $f$ over an interval $I.$ Then

i.for each constant $C$ the function $F(x)+C$ is also an antiderivative of $f$ over $I$

ilif G is an antiderivative of $f$ over $I$ , there is a constant $C$ for which $G(x)=F(x)+C$ over $I$

In other words,themostgeneral form of the antiderivative of $f$ over $I$ is $F(x)+C$

We use this fact and our knowledge of derivatives to find all the antiderivatives for several functions.

## Example 4.50

### Finding Antiderivatives

For each of the following functions.find all antiderivatives
a. f(x) = 3x²
b. f(x) = 1/x
c. f(x) = cos x
d. f(x) = eˣ

## Solution

a.Because

d/dx(x³)=3x²

then $F(x)=x^{3}$ is an antiderivative of $3x^2$ .Therefore, every antiderivative of $3x^2$ is of the form $x^3+C$ for some constant $C$ and every function of the form $x^{3}+C$ is an antiderivative of $3x^2$

b. Let f(x)=ln|x| .For $x>0$ ， 
16) f(x) = ln(x) and

d/dx(ln x) = 1/x. 

For $x<0$ f(x)=ln(-x) and

d/dx(ln(-x))=1/x

Therefore,

d/dx(ln|x|)=1/x

Thus, F(x)=ln|x| is an antiderivative of 1/x Therefore, every antiderivative of 1/x is of the form ln|x|+C for some constant $C$ and every function of the form ln|x|+C is an antiderivative of 1/x C. We have

d/dx(sin x)=cos x,

SO F(x) = sin x is an antiderivative of cosx. Therefore, every antiderivative of  cos x  is of the form 
6) sin x + C for some constant C and every function of the form 
6) sin x + C is an antiderivative of cos.x. d.Since

d/dx(eˣ) = eˣ

then $F(x)=e^{x}$ is an antiderivative of e^λ . Therefore, every antiderivative of $e^{x}$ is of the form $e^{x}+C$ for some constant $C$ and every function of the form $e^{x}+C$ is an antiderivative of e^λ

4.49 Find all antiderivatives of f(x)=sin x

## Indefinite Integrals

We now look at the formal notation used to represent antiderivatives and examine some of their properties. These properties allow usto find antiderivatives of more complicated functions. Given a function $f$ we use the notation f'(x) ord to denote the derivative of $f$ Here we introduce notation for antiderivatives. If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ ，we say that $F(x)+C$ is the most general antiderivative of $f$ and write

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C.

The symbol ∫ is called an integral sign, and ∫f(x)dx is called the indefinite integral of $f$

### Definition

Given a function $f$ the indefinite integral of $f$ denoted

∫f(x)dx,

is the most general antiderivative of $f.$ If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ ，then

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C.

The expression $f(x)$ is called the integrand and the variable $X$ is the variable of integration

Given the terminology introduced in this definition, the act of finding the antiderivatives of a function $f$ is usually referred to as integrating $f$

For a function $f$ and an antiderivative $F$ the functions $F(x)+C$ ，where $C$ is any real number, is often referred to as the family of antiderivatives of $f$ For example, since $x^2$ is an antiderivative of $2x$ and any antiderivative of $2x$ is of the form $x^{2}+C$ we write

∫2xdx=x²+C.

The collection of all functions of the form $x^{2}+C$ ，where $C$ is any real number,isknown as the family of antiderivatives of $2x$ Figure 4.85 shows a graph of this family of antiderivatives

![](./images/fNeV8kRXgN95FWF5vl0xGhMzwRu9hPTgs.png)
Figure 4.85The family of antiderivatives of $2x$ consists of all functions of the

form $x^{2}+C$ ，where $C$ is any real number

For some functions, evaluating indefinite integrals follows directly from properties of derivatives. For example, for n ≠ -1

∫xⁿdx=xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)+C,

which comes directly from

d/dx(xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1))=(n+1)xⁿ/(n+1)=xⁿ

This fact is known as the power rule for inteqrals.

# Theorem 4.15: Power Rule for Integrals

For n ≠ -1

∫xⁿdx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C

Evaluating indefinite integrals for some other functions is also a straightforward calculation. The following table lists the indefinite integrals for several common functions. A more complete list appears in Appendix B

Differentiation Formula|Indefinite Integral
Table 4.13 Integration Formulas

From the definition of indefinite integral of $f$ ，we know

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C

if and only if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ Therefore, when claiming that

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C

it is important to check whether this statement is correct by verifying that F'(x)=f(x)

### Example 4.51

### Verifying an Indefinite Integral

Each of the following statements is of the form ∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C Verify that each statement is correct by showing that F'(x)=f(x)

a. ∫(x + eˣ)dx = x²/2 + eˣ + C b. ∫xeˣdx = xeˣ - eˣ + C

### Solution

a.Since

d/dx(x²/2+eˣ+C)=x+eˣ,

the statement

∫(x+eˣ)dx = x²/2 + eˣ + C 

is correct

Note that we ae verifying an indefinite integral for a sum. Furthermore, x²/2 and $e^{.1}$ are antiderivative of $X$ and $e^{x}$ ,respectively, and the sum of the antiderivatives is an antiderivative of the sum. We discus this fact again later in this section.

b.Using the product rule, we see that

d/dx(xeˣ - eˣ + C) = eˣ + xeˣ - eˣ = xeˣ

Therefore, the statement

∫xeˣdx = xeˣ - eˣ + C

is correct. Note that we are verifying an indefinite integral for a product. The antiderivative $xe^{x}-e^{x}$ is not

a product of the antiderivatives. Furthermore, the product of antiderivatives, $x^2e^x/2$ is not an antiderivative of $xe^{x}$ since

d/dx((x²eˣ)/2)=xeˣ+x²eˣ/2≠xeˣ.

In general, the product of antiderivatives is not an antiderivative of a product

# 4.50 Verifythat ∫x cos x dx = x sin x + cos x + C

In Table 4.13, we listed the indefinite integrals for many elementary functions. Let's now turn our attention to evaluating indefinite integrals for more complicated functions. For example, consider finding an antiderivative of a sum $f+g$ In Example 4.51a we showed ha an anidervative f the sum x+e^λ is give by the sumn (x²/2) + eˣ -that is, an antiderivative of a sum is given by a sum of antiderivatives. This result was not specific to this example. In general, if $F$ and $G$ are antiderivatives of any functions $f$ and $g$ ,respectively, ther

d/dx(F(x) + G(x)) = F'(x) + G'(x) = f(x) + g(x)

Therefore, $F(x)+G(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)+g(x)$ and we have

∫(f(x) + g(x))dx = F(x) + G(x) + C

Similarly,

∫(f(x) - g(x))dx = F(x) - G(x) + C.

In addition, consider the task of finding an antiderivative of $kf(x)$ ，where $k$ is any real number. Since

d/dx(kf(x)) = k d/dx F(x) = kf'(x)

for any real number $k$ we conclude that

∫ kf(x)dx=kF(x)+C.

These properties are summarized next.

### Theorem 4.16:Properties of Indefinite Integrals

Let $F$ and G be antiderivatives of $f$ and $g$ respectively, and let $k$ be any real number.

Sums and Differences

∫(f(x)±g(x))dx = F(x)±G(x)+C

Constant Multiplese

∫ kf(x)dx = kF(x) + C

From this theorem, we can evaluate any integral involving a sum, difference, or constant multiple of functions with antiderivatives that are known. Evaluating integrals involving products, quotients, or compositions is more complicated (see Example 4.51b. for an example involving an antiderivative of a product.) We look at and address integrals involving these more complicated functions in Introduction to Integration.In the next example,we examine how to use this theorem to calculate the indefinite integrals of several functions

# Example 4.52

Evaluating Indefinite Integrals

Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals

a. ∫(5x³ - 7x² + 3x + 4)dx b.  ∫(x² + 4x^(1/3))/x dx  C. 
∫4/(1+x²)dx d.Stanxcos xdx

### Solution

a.Using Properties ofIndefinite Integrals,we can integrate each of the four terms in the integranc separately. We obtain

∫(5x³-7x²+3x+4)dx = ∫5x³dx - ∫7x²dx + ∫3xdx + ∫4dx.

From the second part of Properties of Indefinite Integrals, each coefficient can be written in front of the integral sign.which gives

∫5x³dx-∫7x²dx+∫3xdx+∫4dx=5∫x³dx-7∫x²dx+3∫xdx+4∫1dx

Using the power rule for integrals, we conclude that

∫(5x³-7x²+3x+4)dx = (5/4)x⁴-(7/3)x³+(3/2)x²+4x

b.Rewrite the integrand as

(x²+4∛x)/x=x+4∛x/x=0

Then, to evaluate the integral, integrate each of these terms separately. Using the power rule, we have
VU 1000, ∫(x + 4/x²/³)dx = ∫xdx + 4∫x⁻²/³dx = (1/2)x² + 12x¹/³ + C, 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1

c.Using Properties of Indefinite Integrals, write the integral as

4∫1/(1+x²)dx

Then, use hefact hat 
tan⁻¹(x) is n andervative o {xᵢ*} to cocludetha

∫4/(1+x²)dx=4tan⁻¹(x)+C

d.Rewrite the integrand as

tanxcosx=sinx/cosxcosx=sinx

Therefore,

∫tanxcosx=∫sinx=-cosx+C.

## Initial-Value Problems

We look at techniques for integrating a large variety of functions involving products, quotients, and compositions later in the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential equations.

A differential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equatior

dy/dx=f(x)

is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function $y$ with a derivative $f$ Therefore, the solutions of Equation 4.9 are the antiderivatives of $f$ If $F$ is one antiderivative of $f$ ，every function of the form $y=F(x)+C$ is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions o

dy/dx = 6x²

are given by

y = ∫6x²dx = 2x³ + C

Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a certain point $(x_0,y_0)$ —that is, $y(x_{0})=y_{0}$ .The problem of finding a function $y$ that satisfies a differential equation

dy/dx=f(x)

with the additional condition

$$y(x_0)=y_0$$

is an example of an initial-value problem. The condition $y(x_0)=y_0$ is known as an initial condition. For example, looking for a function $y$ that satisfies the differential equatior

dy/dx = 6x²

and the initial condition

$$y(1)=5$$

is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are $y=2x^{3}+C$ ，to find a function $y$ that also satisfies the initial condition, we need to find $C$ such that $y(1)=2(1)^{3}+C=5$ . From this equation we see that $C=3$ ，and we conclude that $y=2x^{3}+3$ is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the following graph..

![](./images/ftgrTWLEnYzOgHPC8o6NWiPcdHS3KPfMZ.png)
Figure 4.a Some o th solution curve of th iferentia equaton dy/dx=6x²

are displayed. The function $y=2x^{3}+3$ satisfies the differential equation and the initial condition $y(1)=5$

### Example 4.53

### Solving an Initial-Value Problem

Solve the initial-value problem


dy/dx = sin x, y(0) = 5.

### Solution

First we need to solve the differental equation. If. dy/dx=sin x ：ther

y = ∫sin(x)dx = -cos x + C

Next we need to look for a solution $y$ that satisfies the initial condition. The initial condition $y(0)=5$ means we need a constant $C$ such that -cos(x) + C = 5 .Therefore,

C = 5 + cos(0) = 6.

The solution of the initial-value problem is y=-cos x+6

4.52 Solve the initial value problem dy/dx=3x⁻² $y(1)=2$

![](./images/fZRDB7Tx4fTE8kXfOcv2Zm1GZFa9e0Sg5.png)

Initial-value problems arise in many applications. Next we consider a problem in which a driver applies the brakes in a car

We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the velocity function ν(t) is the derivative of a position function $s(t)$ ，and the acceleration $a(t)$ is the derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could calculate the velocity from the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work the other way around. Given an acceleration function, we calculate the velocity function.We then use the velocity function to determine the position function.

# Example 4.54

## Decelerating Car

A car is traveling at the rate of 88 ft/sec $60mph$ ) when the brakes are applied. The car begins decelerating at a constant rate of 15 ft/sec²

a.How many seconds elapse before the car stops? b.How far does the car travel during that time

### Solution

a.First we introduce variables for this problem. Let $t$ be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first applied. Let $a(t)$ be the acceleration of the car (in feet per seconds squared) at time $t$ .Let ν(t) be the velocity of the car (in feet per second) at time $t$ .Let $s(t)$ be the car's position (in feet) beyond the poin where the brakes are applied at time $t$

The car is traveling at a rate of 88 ft/sec. Therefore, the initial velocity is ν(0)=88 ft/sec. Since the car is decelerating, the acceleration is

a(t) = -15 fu/s²

The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity

ν'(t)=-15

Therefore.we have an initial-yalue problem to solve:

v'(t)=-15, v(0)=88

Integrating, we find that

ν(t)=-15t+C

Since ν(0)=88 ， $C=88$ .Thus, the velocity function is

$$v(t)=-15t+88.$$

To find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time $t$ such that the velocity is zero Solving $-15t+88=0$ ，we obtain t=88/15 sec

b.To findhwfar thear tavels dring his tme, wened to findthe positon of the car af 88/15 sec.We know the velocity ν(t) is the derivative of the position $s(t)$ .Consider the initial position to be $s(0)=0$ Therefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem

s'(t)=-15t+88, s(0)=0

Integrating, we have

s(t) = (-15/2)t² + 88t + C

Since $s(0)=0$ ，the constant is $C=0$ Therefore, the position function is

s(t)=-15/2t²+88t.

After t=88/15 sec, the psition is s(88/15) ≈ 258.133 f

4.53 Suppose the car is traveling at the rate of 44 ft/sec. How long does it take for the car to stop? How far will thecar travel?

### 4.3 Maxima and Minima

·A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, have just one absolute extremum, or have no absolute maximum or absolute minimum •If a function has a local extremum, the point at which it occurs must be a critical point. However, a function need not have a local extremum at a critical point ·A continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. Each extremum occurs at a critical point or an endpoint

### 4.4 The Mean Value Theorem

·If $f$ is continuous over $[a,b]$ and differentiable over $(a,b)$ and $f(a)=0=f(b)$ ，then there exists a point

## 4.6 Limits at Infinity and Asymptotes.

•The limit of $f(x)$ is $L$ as x→∞ (or as x→-∞ ） if the values $f(x)$ become arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ becomes sufficiently large. ·The limit of $f(x)$ is ∞0 as x→∞ if $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily large as $x$ becomes sufficiently large. The limit of $f(x)$ is -∞ as x→∞ if $f(x)<0$ and $|f(x)|$ becomes arbitrarily large as $x$ becomes sufficiently large. We can define the limit of $f(x)$ as $X$ approaches -∞ similarly

### 4.9 Newton's Method

•Newton’s method approximates roots of $f(x)=0$ by starting with an initial approximation $x_0$ ,then uses tangent lines to the graph of $f$ to create a sequence of approximations $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$, ... •Typically, Newton’s method is an efficient method for finding a particular root. In certain cases, Newton's metho fails to work because the list of numbers $x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2, .$ X2 $x_{2}$ . does not approach a finite value or it approaches a value other than the root sought. · Any process in which a list of numbers $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, … is generated by defining an initial number $X_{0}$ and defining the subsequent numbers by the equation $x_{n}=F(x_{n-1})$ for some function $F$ is an iterative process.

## Introduction

Iceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to sailboats, but they are fitted with runners, or “skates,” and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on water. Iceboats can move very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top iceboat racers can attain

speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is moving, we can use integration to determine how far it travels. We revisit this question later in the chapter (see Example 5.27).

Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide variety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use integrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiation and integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications.

# 5.1 | Approximating Areas


d/dx(k)=0|∫k dx =  ∫kx⁰dx=kx+C

Archimedes was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapes—in other words, the amount of space enclosed by the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion, which used smaller and smaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and closer approximations to the total area. In this proces, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region

In this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function $f(x)$ ，andthe $x$ -axis on a closed interval [a, b]. Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known area (namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and closer approximations to the area. Taking a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.

Let's start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when $f(x)$ is continuous and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop techniques that apply in more general cases.

# Sigma (Summation) Notation

As mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by curves. This process often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these lengthy sums, we look at some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation notation). The Greek capital letter Σ ，sigma,

is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20 without sigma notation, we have to write

$$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17+18+19+20.$$

We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write

1+2+3+4+…+19+20

which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation,we write this sum as

∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰i,

which is much more compact.

Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form


∑_(i=1)^naᵢ

where $a_{i}$ describes the terms to be added, and the $i$ is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the values

beginig it t ae iee $i=1$ and edin it h ale iee $i=n$ Fo esaple epeso e ∑ᵢ₌₂⁷ sᵢ is

interpreted as $s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{4}+s_{5}+s_{6}+s_{7}.$ Note that the index is used only to keep track of the terms to be added; it does not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is therefore called a dummy variable. We can use any letter we like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use $i,j,k,m$ , and $n$ for indices.

Let's try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.

### Example 5.1

### Using Siqma Notation

a.Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms $3^i$ for $i=1$ 23,4,5.

b.Write the sum in sigma notation

1+¼+1/9+1/16+1/25

## Solution

a.Write

∑ᵢ₌₁⁵ 3ⁱ = 3 + 3² + 3³ + 3⁴ + 3⁵ = 363

b.The denominator of each term is a perfect square. Using sigma notation, this sum can be written as ∑ᵢ₌₁⁵1/i²

![](./images/fGlX6xu0QgapyA0FqImKfgGGE8yMPghdY.png)

5.1Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms $2^i$ for $i=3$ .4.5.6

The properties associated with the summation process are given in the following rule.

### Rule: Properties of Siqma Notation

Let $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ represent two sequences of terms and let $C$ be a constant. The following properties hold for all positive integers $n$ and for integers $m$ ,with 1 ≤ m ≤ n

1.

2.

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿcaᵢ=c∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿaᵢ

3.

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(aᵢ+bᵢ)=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿaᵢ+∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿbᵢ

4.

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(aᵢ-bᵢ)=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿaᵢ-∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿbᵢ

5.

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵐ aᵢ + ∑ᵢ₌ₘ₊₁ⁿ aᵢ

## Proof

We prove properties 2. and 3. here, and leave proof of the other properties to the Exercises.

2. We have

∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>caᵢ=ca₁+ca₂+ca₃+…+caₙ=c(a₁+a₂+a₃+…+aₙ)=c∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>aᵢ

3. We have

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (aᵢ + bᵢ) = (a₁ + b₁) + (a₂ + b₂) + (a₃ + b₃) + ... + (aₙ + bₙ) = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ) + (b₁ + b₂ + b₃ + ... + bₙ) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ + ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ bᵢ

口

A few more formulas for frequently found functions simplify the summation process further. These are shown in the next rule, for sums and powers of integers, and we use them in the next set of examples

### Rule:Sums and Powers of Integers

∑_(i=1)^n i=1+2+⋯+n=n(n+1)/2

2.The sum of consecutive integers squared is given by

 3. The sum of consecutive integers cubed is given by

∑_(i=1)^n i³ = 1³ + 2³ + ... + n³ = n²(n + 1)²/4

b. The sum of the terms (i³-i²) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

### Solution

a. Multiplying out $(i-3)^2$ we can break the expression into three terms

∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰(i−3)² = ∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰(i²−6i+9) = ∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰i²−∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰6i+∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰9 = ∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰i²−6∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰i+∑ᵢ₌₁²⁰⁰9 = 200(200+1)(400+1)/6−6[200(200+1)/2]+9(200) = 2,686,700−120,600+1800 = 2,567,900

b.Use sigma notation property iv. and the rules for the sum of squared terms and the sum of cubed terms.
∑ᵢ₌₁⁶(i³ - i²) = ∑ᵢ₌₁⁶i³ - ∑ᵢ₌₁⁶i² = 6²(6+1)²/4 - 6(6+1)(2(6)+1)/6 = 1764/4 - 546/6 = 350

### Solution

Using the formula, we have

∑_(i=0)^¹⁰i³ = (10)²(10+1)²/4 = 100(121)/4 = 3025

## Approximating Area

Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a curve. Let $f(x)$ be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval $[a,b]$ We want to approximate the area A bounded by $f(x)$ above, the $x$ -axis below, the line $x=a$ on the left, and the line $x=b$ on theright (Figure 5.2)

![](./images/fGZo8BkT9itHsNn5VfEI2xfAMN4Z3oP0W.png)
Figure 5.2 An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve

$f(x)$ at top, the $x$ axis at bottom, the line $x=a$ to the left, and the line $x=b$ at right

How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region into many small shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable estimate of the true area. We begin by dividing the interval $[a,b]$ $b]$ b into Tr subintervals of equal width, (b-a)/n We do this by selecting equally spaced points $x_0$, $x_1$, x₂, …, xₙ with $x_{0}=a$ $x_{n}=b$ ，and

xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁ = (b-a)/n

fori=12,3....n

We denote the width of each subinterval with the notation Δx sox=b=aanc

xᵢ=x₀+iΔx

for $i=1$ , 2, 3.,..., n. This notion of dividing an interval $[a,b]$ $b]$ b into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let's define some relevant terminology

### Definition

A set of points P={xᵢ} for i=0 $i=0$ $i=0,1,2,...,n$ with a = x₀ < x₁ < x₂ < ... < xₙ = b, which divides the interval $[a,b]$ into subintervals of the form $[ x_0$, $x_1] , [ x_1$, x₂, …, xₙ₋₁, $x_n]$ is called a partition of $[a,b].$ If the subintervals all have the same width, the set of points forms a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$

We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next examine two methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation.

### Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation

On each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ (for $i= 1$, 2, 3, …, n ).construct a rectangle with width Δx and height equal to $f(x_{i-1})$ , which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is f(xᵢ₋₁)Δx .Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A (Figure 5.3). We use the notation $L_n$ to denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation of A using $n$ subintervals.e

![](./images/fLMaK64Ll8xISaPQccv7q0cKTcKDPhUwr.png)

Figure 5.3In the left-endpoint approximation of area under a

curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function yalue at the left of each subinterval

The second method for approximating area under a curve is the right-endpoint approximation. It is almost the same as the left-endpoint approximation, but now the heights of the rectangles are determined by the function values at the right of each subinterval.e

# Rule: Right-Endpoint Approximation

 Construct a rectangle on each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ ,only this time the height of the rectangle is determined by the function value $f(x_i)$ at the right endpoint of the subinterval. Then, the area of each rectangle is f(xᵢ)Δx and the approximation fore $A$ is given by

A≈Rₙ = f(x₁)Δx+f(x₂)Δx+⋯+f(xₙ)Δx = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx

The notation $R_n$ indicates this is a right-endpoint approximation for A (Figure 5.4)

![](./images/fRnQbue2fQBQTu5puDRscBZB6Xh8In8Y3.png)
Figure 5.4In the right-endpoint approximation of area under

a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoint approximation in Figure 5.3.

The graphs i Figure 5.5 represent the curve f(x)=x²/2 . In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the interval [0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, Δx=0.5 .We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines perpendicular to $x_{i-1}$ ,the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating $f(x_{i-1})$ for $i=1$ , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The intervals are [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2], [2, 2.5], [2.5, 3]. We find the area of each rectangle by multiplying the height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area between $f(x)$ and the $X$ -axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint approximation. Thus,

Fiqure 5.5 Methods of approximating the area under a curve by using (a) the left endpoint

and (b) the right endpoints

In Figure 5.5(b), we draw vertical lines perpendicular to $x_i$ such that $x_i$ is the right endpoint of each subinterval, and calculate $f(x_i)$ for $i=1$ , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We multiply each $f(x_i)$ by Δx to find the rectangular areas, and then add them. This is a right-endpoint approximation of the area under $f(x)$ .Thus,

A≈R₆ =∑ᵢ₌₁ᵇf(xᵢ)Δx=f(x₁)Δx+f(x₂)Δx+f(x₃)Δx+f(x₄)Δx+f(x₅)Δx+f(x₆)Δx =f(0.5)0.5+f(1)0.5+f(1.5)0.5+f(2)0.5+f(2.5)0.5+f(3)0.5 =0.0625+0.25+0.5625+1+1.5625+2.25 =5.6875.

# Example 5.4

Approximating the Area Under a Curve

Use both left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations to approximate the area under the curve of $f(x)=x^{2}$ on the interval [0, 2]; use $n=4$

### Solution

First, divide the interval IO 2 into equl subintervals using $n=4$ Δx=(2-0)/4=0.5 This is the with of each rectangle. The intervals [0, 0.5] 0.5, 1], [1, 1.5] [1.5, 2]are shown in Figure 5.6. Using a left-endpoin approximation, the heights are $f(0)=0$ $f(0.5)=0.25$ $f(1)=1$ $f(1.5)=2.25$ . Then,

Figure 5.6 The graph shows the left-endpoint approximation

of the area under $f(x)=x^2$ from O to 2.

The right-endpoint approximation is shown in Figure 5.7. The intervals are the same, Δx=0.5 ，but now use the right endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles.We have

V R₄ = f(x₁)Δx + f(x₂)Δx + f(x₃)Δx + f(x₄)Δx = 0.25(0.5) + 1(0.5) + 2.25(0.5) + 4(0.5) = 3.75.

Figure 5.7 The graph shows the right-endpoint approximation

of the area under $f(x)=x^{2}$ from 0 to 2.

The left-endpoint approximation is 1.75; the right-endpoint approximation is 3.75.

5.4 Sketch left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations for. f(x) = 1/x on[1,2]；: use $n=4$ Approximate the area using both methods.

Looking at Figure 5.5 and the graphs in Example 5.4, we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of the area under the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition, our estimate of A will improve. We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will be able to fit the rectangles to the curve more precisely.

We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let's explore the idea of increasing $n$ , first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight rectangles, and finally 32 rectangles. Then, let's do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using the same sets of intervals, of the same curved region Figure 5.8 shows the area of the region under the curve $f(x)=(x-1)^{3}+4$ on the interval [O, 2] using a left-endpoint approximation where $n=4$ .The width of each rectangle is

Δx = (2-0)/4 = 1/2

The area is approximated by the summed areas of the rectangles, or

![](./images/fDZLKiOQVG4VRQspKd12rPFvxYYwReVxu.png)

Figure 5.8 With a left-endpoint approximation and dividing

the region from a to $b$ into four equal intervals, the area under the curve is approximately equal to the sum of the areas of the rectangles

Figure 5.9 shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in Figure 5.8 with this graph with eight rectangles,we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve when $n=8$ .This white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The area of the rectangles is

L₈ = f(0)(0.25) + f(0.25)(0.25) + f(0.5)(0.25) + f(0.75)(0.25) + f(1)(0.25) + f(1.25)(0.25) + f(1.5)(0.25) + f(1.75)(0.25) = 7.75

![](./images/fCpgrFt4oG4YeuO7aGUNnU2OPUUnh5gVm.png)
Figure 5.9 The region under the curve is divided into $n=8$

rectangular areas of equal width for a left-endpoint approximation

The graph in Figure 5.10 shows the same function with 32 rectangles inscribed under the curve. There appears to be little white space left. The area occupied by the rectangles is

L₃₂ = f(0)(0.0625) + f(0.0625)(0.0625) + f(0.125)(0.0625) + ... + f(1.9375)(0.0625)
= 7.9375.

![](./images/fGEk1ZfMlqhYDtcX1pnghtS7A89PXLlId.png)

Figure 5.10 Here, 32 rectangles are inscribed under the curve for a left-endpoint approximation

We can carry out a similar process for the right-endpoint approximation method.A right-endpoint approximation of the same curve, using four rectangles (Figure 5.11), yields an area

R4 = f(0.5)(0.5)+f(1)(0.5)+f(1.5)(0.5)+f(2)(0.5) = 8.5

![](./images/fPH7XOADgMiCQfveGf36xW5ebGeeElCQW.png)

Figure 5.11Now we divide the area under the curve into four equal subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation.

Dividing the region over the interval [O, 2] into eight rectangles results in Δx = (2-0)/8 = 0.25 . The graph is shown in Fiqure 5.12.The area is

R₈ = f(0.25)(0.25) + f(0.5)(0.25) + f(0.75)(0.25) + f(1)(0.25) + f(1.25)(0.25) + f(1.5)(0.25) + f(1.75)(0.25) + f(2)(0.25) = 8.25 

![](./images/flGXY3AKVtlXGY9dVAEq9eM4b2vFVUgpI.png)
Figure 5.12Here we use right-endpoint approximation for a

region divided into eight equal subintervals.

Last, the right-endpoint approximation with $n=32$ is close to the actual area (Figure 5.13). The area is approximately
R₃₂=f(0.0625)(0.0625)+f(0.125)(0.0625)+f(0.1875)(0.0625)+…+f(2)(0.0625)
=8.0625

![](./images/fNrpy1m3ppgEiOHx1ZNK3Mgc4ls0CBK66.png)
Figure 5.13The region is divided into 32 equal subintervals

for a right-endpoint approximation.

Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to approximate the area under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as $n$ increases, both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations appear to approach an area of 8 square units. Table 5.1 shows a numerical comparison of the left- and right-endpoint

methods. The idea that the approximations of the area under the curve get better and better as n gets larger and larger is very important, and we now explore this idea in more detail.

## Forming Riemann Sums

So far we have been using rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. The heights of these rectangles have been determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval $[ x_{i- 1}$, $x_{i}]$ . In reality, there is no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only. We could evaluate the function at any point $x_i$ in the subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ ， and use $f(x_i^*)$ as the height of our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the area of the form

A ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*)Δx

A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum, named for the 19th-century mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who developed the idea.

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and let $P$ be a regular partition of $[a,b].$ Let Δx be the width of each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ and for each i, let $x_i^{2k}$ be any point in $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ . A Riemann sum is defined for $f(x)$ as

∑_(i=1)^n f(xᵢ*)Δx.

Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as $n$ get larger and larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations for larger values of $n$ .We are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums

# Definition

Let $f(x)$ b coainuous oneaiv funcio o an iterale $[a,b]$ andete ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ* Δx bea Rieman sum forn $f(x)$ . Then, the area under the curve $y=f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ is given by

A=lim_(n→∞)Σ_(i=1)^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

O See a graphical demonstration (http://www.openstax.org//20_riemannsums) of the costruction of a

Some subtleties here are worth discussing. First, note that taking the limit of a sum is a little different from taking the limit of a function $f(x)$ as $X$ goes to infinity.Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter on Sequences and Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53756/latest/) ; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used to compute limits of functions can also be used to calculate limits of sums.

Second, we must consider what to do if the expression converges to diferen limis for different choices of {xᵢ*} Fortunately, this does not happen. Although the proof is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown that if $f(x)$ is continos on hecloed ntrva a t, e limₙ→∞Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) Δx exis nd niaue i the oresi does o deene on the choiceof {xᵢ*}

We look at some examples shortly. But, before we do, let's take a moment and talk about some specific choices for {xᵢ*} Although any choice for {xᵢ*} gives us an estimate of the area under the curve, we don't necessarily know whether that estimate is too high (overestimate) or too low (underestimate). If it is important to know whether our estimate is high o low, we can select our value fr {xᵢ*} to guarantee one result or the other

If we want an overestimate, for example, we can choose {xᵢ*} such that for $i=1,2,3,...,n$ $f( x_{i}^{* }$ )≥f(x) for all x∈[xᵢ₋₁,xᵢ] . In other words, we choose {xᵢ*} so that for $i=1$ ,2, 3....,n, $f(x_i^*)$ is the maximum function value on the iteral $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ I we ete {xᵢ*} in thi ayg henthe lean su ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ* Δx is cald a upersum Similarly if we want anunderestimate, wecan chose {xᵢ*} so that for $i=1$ , 2., .., m,. $f(x_i^*$ ) is the minimum function value on the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ . In this case, the associated Riemann sum is called a lower sum. Note that if $f(x)$ is either increasing or decreasing throughout the interval $[a,b]$, then the maximum and minimum values of the function occur at the endpoints of the subintervals, so the upper and lower sums are just the same as the left- and right-endpoint approximations.

## Example 5.5

Finding Lower and Upper Sums

Find a lower sum for $f(x)=10-x^{2}$ on [1, 2]; let $n=4$ subintervals

### Solution

With $n=4$ over the interval[1.2], Δx=1/4 We can list the intervals as [1, 1.25], [1.25, 1.5], [1.5, 1.75], [1.75, 2] Because the function is decreasing over the interval [1, 2], Figure 5.14 shows that a lower sum is obtained by using the right endpoints

Figure 5.14The graph of $f(x)=10-x^{2}$ is set up for a

right-endpoint approximation of the area bounded by the curve and the $x$ -axis on [1, 2], and it shows a lower sum.

### The Riemann sum is
∑_(k=1)⁴ (10-x²)(0.25) = 0.25[10-(1.25)²+10-(1.5)²+10-(1.75)²+10-(2)²] = 0.25[8.4375+7.75+6.9375+6] = 7.28

The area of 7.28 is a lower sum and an underestimate.

# 5.2 | The Definite Integral.

# Learning Objectives.

5.2.1State the definition of the definite integral. 5.2.2 Explain the terms integrand, limits of integration, and variable of integration 5.2.3 Explain when a function is integrable 5.2.4 Describe the relationship between the definite integral and net area.. 5.2.5 Use geometry and the properties of definite integrals to evaluate them 5.2.6 Calculate the average value of a function.

In the preceding section we defined the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums:

A=lim_(n→∞)Σ_(i=1)^n f(xᵢ*)Δx

However, this definition came with restrictions. We required $f(x)$ to be continuous and nonnegative. Unfortunately, realworld problems don’t always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to apply the concept of the area under the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite integral.

## Definition and Notation

The definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.

### Definition

If $f(x)$ is a function defined on an interval $[a,b]$, the definite integral of $f$ from a to $b$ is given by

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*)Δx,

 provided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function $f(x)$ is said to be integrable on $[a,b]$, or is an integrable functiond

The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on Applications of Derivatives, where we used the indefinite integral symbol (without the a and $b$ above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation for indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related. However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we're working with a definite integral or an indefinite integral.

Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The integration symbol ↑is an elongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the boundaries of the interval, [a, b]. The numbers α and $b$ are $x$ values and are called the limits of integration; specifically, a is the lower limit

and $b$ is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of the definite integral. First, we talk about the limit of a sum as II → ℂO .Second, the boundaries of the region are called the limits of integration.

We call the function $f(x)$ the integrand, and the $dx$ indicates that $f(x)$ is a function with respect to $X.$ called the variable

of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no impact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration:


∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)dx = ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(t)dt = ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(u)du

Previously we disused the fat thae f $f(x)$ is contiuous o [αa b]l then he limit limₙ→∞Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) Δx exists an is unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof

### Theorem 5.1: Continuous Functions Are Integrable

If $f(x)$ is continuous on [a, b], then $f$ is integrable on [a, b]

Functions that are not continuous on $[a,b]$ may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For example, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are integrable

It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for the Riemann sums.

## Example 5.7

Evaluating an Integral Using the Definition

Uuse th defniton o te dei neat valate ∫₀²x²dx Use aright endpin procimatin t eneee the Riemann sum.

## Solution

We first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have $a=0$ and $b=2$ .For $i=0$ 1,2..nlet P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of [0, 2]. Then

Δx=(b-a)/n=2/n

Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate the function value at the right endpoint of the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ . The right endpoint of the interval is $x_{i}$, and since $P$ is a regular partition,

xᵢ = x₀ + iΔx = 0 + i[2/n] = 2i/n.

Thus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is

f(xᵢ)=xᵢ²=(2i/n)²=4i²/n².

Then the Riemann sum takes the form

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(4i²/n²)²=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ(8i²/n³)=(8/n³)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿi²

USing h umntio emla o ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿi² wehave

### Evaluating Definite Integrals

Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations. Later in this chapter we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann sums. However, for now, we can rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve, and we can evaluate definite integrals by using geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to confirm that definite integrals do,inded, represent areas, so we can then discuss what to do in the case of a curve of a function dropping below the $x$ -axis.

## Example 5.8

 Using Geometric Formulas to Calculate Definite Integrals

Uuse the formulaforth area cicl t valate ∫₃⁶√(9-(x-3)²)dx

### Solution

The function describes a semicircle with radius 3. To find

∫₃⁶∜(9-(x-3)²)dx,

we want to find the area under the curve over the interval [3, 6]. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr² The area of a semicircle i just one-half the area of circle, or A = (1/2)πr² The shaded area in Figure 5.16 covers one-half of the semicircle, or A=(1/4)πr² .Thus,

Use the formula forth are of rapezoi to evaluae ∫₂⁴(2x + 3)dx

## Area and the Definite Integral.

When we defined the definite integral, we lifted the requirement that $f(x)$ be nonnegative. But how do we interpret “the area under the curve” when $f(x)$ is negative?

### Net Signed Area

Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function $f(x)=2-2x^{2}$ (shown in Figure 5.17) on the interval [0., 2]. Use $n=8$ and choose {xᵢ*} as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each subinterval of height $f(x_i^*)$ and width Δx . When $f(x_i^*)$ is positive, the product f(xᵢ*)Δx represents the area of the rectangle, as before. When $f(x_i^*)$ is negative, however, the product f(xᵢ*)Δx represents the negative of the area of the rectangle. The Riemann sum then become.

∑ᵢ₌₁⁸ f(xᵢ*)Δx = (Area of rectangles above the x-axis) - (Area of rectangles below the x-axis)

![](./images/fuUPVVQ6v9bLgA6ah3RAquaBuE7mNbf5r.png)
Figure 5.17 For a function that is partly negative, the

Riemann sum is the area of the rectangles above the $x$ -axis less the area of the rectangles below the $x$ -axis.

Taking the limit as n→∞ ，the Riemann sum approaches the area between the curve above the $x$ -axis and the $x$ -axis, less the area between the curve below the $X$ -axis and the $x$ axis,as shown in Figure 5.18. Then,

∫₀²f(x)dx=lim_(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(cᵢ)Δx=A₁-A₂.

The quantity $A_1-A_2$ is called the net signed area.

![](./images/fMtlgdkLhGvgBwGBf96TWI5VO3ggDKigh.png)

Figure 5.18 In the limit, the definite integral equals area $A_1$ less area $A_2$ , or the net signed area

Notice that net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. If the area above the $x$ axis is larger, the net signed area is positive. If the area below the $x$ -axis is larger, the net signed area is negative. If the areas above and below the $x$ -axis are equal, the net signed area is zero.

# Example 5.9

### Finding the Net Signed Area

Find the net signed area between the curve of the function $f(x)=2x$ and the $X$ -axis over the interval [—3, 3]

### Solution

The function produces a straight line that forms two triangles: one from $x=-3$ to $x=0$ and the other from $x=0$ to $x=3$ (Figure 5.19). Using the geometric formula for the area of a triangle, A = (1/2)bh ，the area o triangle $A_1$ , above the axis, is

A₁=1/2(3)(6)=9,

where 3 is the base and 2(3)=6 is the height. The area of triangle $A_{2}$ , below the axis, is

A₂=1/2(3)(6)=9,

where 3 is the base and 6 is the height. Thus, the net area is

![](./images/fYEONStgDIC5RC6YaC9sBRlBtmEOKbNoU.png)
Figure 5.19 The area above the curve and below the $x$ axis

equals the area below the curve and above the $x$ -axis.

## Analysis

If $A_1$ is the area above the $x$ axis and $A_2$ is the area below the $x$ -axis, then the net area is $A_1-A_2$ .Since the areas of the two triangles are equal, the net area is zero

5.9 Find the net signed area of $f(x)=x-2$ over the interval [O, 6], illustrated in the following image

![](./images/faAzTeGPgSIPl1Eyw89S7VaRs0pzBFsxu.png)

### Total Area

One application of the definite integral is finding displacement when given a velocity function. If ν(t) represents the

velocity of an object as a function of time. then the area under the curve tells us how far the object is from its original position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we examine it in more detail later in the chapter For now, we're just going to look at some basics to get a feel for how this works by studying constant velocities.

When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very familiar. If a car travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 75 mph for 2 hours, then it is 150 mi away from its original position (Figure 5.20). Using integral notation, we have

![](./images/fsl2YGgd29hH5GhoExMAEMZIWvL5dWnFD.png)
is from its starting point at a given time.

In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels straight north at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is $120mi$ north of its starting position. If the car then turns around and travels south at a speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position (Figure 5.21). Again, using integral notation, we have

∫₀²60dt+∫₂⁵-40dt=120-120=0

In this case the displacement is zero.

![](./images/fbGi93GRsqWIBWeNS5MxpWzCdw6QksHD6.png)
Figure 5.21 The area above the axis and the area below the axis

are equal, so the net signed area is zero.

Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to know the area between the curve and the $x$ -axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis. This is called the total area

Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas below the axis (rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To accomplish this mathematically, we use the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the car is

∫₀²|60|dt+∫₂⁵|-40|dt =∫₀²60dt+∫₂⁵40dt =120+120 =240.

Bringing these ideas together formally, we state the following definitions

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be an integrable function defined on an interval [a, $b]$ Let $A_1$ represent the area between $f(x)$ and the $x$ -axis that lies above the axis and let $A_2$ represent the area between $f(x)$ and the $x$ axis that lies below the axis. Then, the net signed area between $f(x)$ and the $X$ -axis is given by

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=A₁-A₂

The total area between $f(x)$ and the A -axis is given by

∫ₐᵇ|f(x)|dx = A₁ + A₂

# Example 5.10

## Finding the Total Area.

Find the total area between $f(x)=x-2$ and the $x$ -axis over the interval [0, 6]

### Solution

Calculate the $x$ -intercept as (2.0) (set $y=0$ .solve for x). To find the total area, take the area below the $x$ -axis over the subinterval [O, 2] and add it to the area above the $x$ -axis on the subinterval 2, 6](Figure 5.22)

![](./images/fZQTDlpWkdTu86WOrgU7grzAkZFVdCStx.png)

Figure 5.22 The total area between the line and the $x$ -axis over [0, 6] is $A_{2}$ plus $A_1$

We have

∫₀⁶|(x-2)|dx=A₂+A₁

Then, using the formula for the area of a triangle, we obtain

A₂ = (1/2)bh = (1/2)•2•2 = 2, A₁ = (1/2)bh = (1/2)•4•4 = 8

$$A_1+A_2=8+2=10.$$

The total area, then, is

5.10Find the total areabetween the function $f(x)=2x$ and the $X$ -axis over the interval [—3.3]

## Properties of the Definite Integral

The properties of indefinite integrals apply to definite integrals as well. Definite integrals also have properties that relate to the limits of integration. These properties, along with the rules of integration that we examine later in this chapter, help us manipulate expressions to evaluate definite integrals

## Rule: Properties of the Definite Integral

1.

∫ₐᵃf(x)dx = 0

2.

3.

4.

6.

If the limits of integration are the same, the integral is just a line and contains no area

∫ᵇₐf(x)dx=-∫ᵃᵇf(x)dx

If the limits are reversed, then place a negative sign in front of the integral

∫ₐᵇ[f(x)+g(x)]dx=∫ₐᵇf(x)dx+∫ₐᵇg(x)dx

The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals

∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx = ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx - ∫ₐᵇg(x)dx

The integral of a difference is the difference of the integrals.

∫ₐᵇcf(x)dx=c∫ₐᵇf(x)

for constant c. The integral of the product of a constant and a function is equal to the constant multiplied by the integral of the function

y=3-4√2

Although this formula normally applies when $C$ is between a and $b$ ,the formula holds for all values of a, $b$ ,and C, provided $f(x)$ is integrable on the largest interval

### Comparison Properties of Integrals

A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function $f(x)$ is above another function $g(x)$ ,then the area between $f(x)$ and the $X$ axis is greater than the area between $g(x)$ and the $x$ -axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether $a<b$ a<b $a=b$ α=b $a< b, a= b$, or$a>b$ α>b $a>b$ .The following properties, however, concern only the case a≤b ,and are used when we want to compare the sizes of integrals

## Theorem 5.2: Comparison Theorem

i. If f(x)≥0 for a ≤ x ≤ b ，then

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≥0

ii.If f(x)≥g(x) for a ≤ x ≤ b then

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx ≥ ∫ₐᵇg(x)dx.

l.If $m$ and $M$ are constants such that m ≤ f(x) ≤ M for a ≤ x ≤ b ，then

m(b-a)≤∫ₐᵇf(x)dx ≤ M(b-a).

## Example 5.13

Comparing Two Functions over a Given Interval

Compare f(x)=√(1+x²) and g(x)=√(1+x) over the interval [0, 1]

### Solution

Graphing these functions is necessary to understand how they compare over the interval [O, 1]. Initially, when graphed on a graphing calculator, $f(x)$ appears to be above $g(x)$ everywhere. However, on the interval [0, 1] the graphs appear to be on top of each other. We need to zoom in to see that, on the interval [O, 1], $g(x)$ is above $f(x)$ .The two functions intersect at $x=0$ and $x=1$ (Figure 5.23)

![](./images/fUXdsfMlN1tyzrAWxHe8frouLeg95fhKn.png)
Figure 5.23(a) The function $f(x)$ appears above the function $g(x)$

except over the interval[O,1](b)Viewing the same graph with a greater zoom shows this more clearly

We can see from the graph that over the interval [O, 1], g(x) ≥ f(x) . Comparing the integrals over the specifiec interal 0 l, we als se that ∫₀¹g(x)dx ≥ ∫₀¹f(x)dx (Figure 5.2) The thin,re-shaded ara shows uests how much difference there is between these two integrals over the interval [O, 1]

Figure 5.24 (a) The graph shows that over the interval

[0, 1], g(x) ≥ f(x) ,where equality holds only at the endpoints of the interval. (b) Viewing the same graph with a greater zoom shows this more clearly.

# Average Value of a Function

We often need to find the average of a set of numbers, such as an average test grade. Suppose you received the following test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your average of test scores and you want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. In this case, there are six test scores. Thus,

(89+90+56+78+100+69)/6=482/6≈80.33.

Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a Bat most schools

Suppose, however, that we have a function ν(t) that gives us the speed of an object at any time t, and we want to find the object's average speed. The function ν(t) takes on an infinite number of values, so we can’t use the process just described. Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a function such as this.

Let $f(x)$ be continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ and let $[a,b]$ be divided into 71 subintervals of width Δx=(b-a)/n Choose a representative $x_i^*$ in each subinterval and calculate $f(x_i^*)$ for $i=1$ i = 1 $i= 1$, 2, …, n .In other words, consider each $f(x_{i}^{*})$ as a sampling of the function over each subinterval. The average value of the function may then be approximated as

(f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+⋯+f(xₙ*))/n,

which is basically the same expression used to calculate the average of discrete values

But we know △x = ba Δx = (b-a)/n Δx = (b-a)/n,son = (b - a)/Δx n=ba n = (b - a)/Δx , and we gee

(f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+⋯+f(xₙ*))/n = (f(x₁*)+f(x₂*)+⋯+f(xₙ*))/((b-a)/Δx)

Folosig roug teaegete te ue a su tae eeea ses ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*), and weaedidin y e fraction. To divide by a fraction, invert the denominator and multiply. Thus, an approximate value for the average value of the function is given by

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) (b-a)/Δx = (Δx/(b-a))∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*) = (1/(b-a))∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ*)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Then, to get the exact average value, take the limit as $m$ goes to infinity. Thus, the average value of a function is given by

1/(b-aⁿ)lim∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(xᵢ)Δx=1/(b-a)∫ₐᵇf(x)dx.

### Definition

Let $f(x)$ be continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ Then, the average value of the function $f(x)$ (or f_(ave) on $[a,b]$ is given by

f<sub>ave</sub>=1/(b-a)∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)dx.

## Example 5.14

 Finding the Average Value of a Linear Function

Find the average value of $f(x)=x+1$ over the interval [0, 5]

### Solution

First, graph the function on the stated interval, as shown in Figure 5.25

![](./images/fgq0gk0AkkppzitxLp6c4UtPtpSRgOVay.png)
Figure 5.25 The graph shows the area under the function

$f(x)=x+1$ over [0, 5].

The region is a trapezoid lying on is side, so we can use the area formula for a trapezoid A=½h(a+b) ，where h represents height, and $a$ and $b$ represent the two parallel sides. Then,

Thus the average value of the function is

∫₀⁵x+1dx = (1/2)h(a+b) = (1/2)*5*(1+6) = 35/2.

(1/5)∫₀⁵x+1dx = (1/5)*(35/2) = 7/2.

5.3.1 Describe the meaning of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals 5.3.2 State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1. 5.3.3 Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, to evaluate derivatives of integrals. 5.3.4 State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 25.3.5 Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, to evaluate definite integrals. 5.3.6 Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration

In the previous two sections, we looked at the definite integral and its relationship to the area under the curve of a function. Unfortunately, so far, the only tools we have available to calculate the value of a definite integral are geometric area formulas and limits of Riemann sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at some more powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.

These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This relationship was discovered and explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early 1700s, and it is codified in what we now call the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which has two parts that we examine in this section. Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of calculus

![](./images/fNgMKgRs1fHev3zOQg5H2gExEK9FylY4a.png)

Isaac Newton’s contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the world. The relationships he discovered, codified as Newton’s laws and the law of universal gravitation, are still taught as foundational material in physics today, and his calculus has spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, read a brief biography (http://www.openstax.org//20_newtonbio) of Newton with multimedia clips.

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let’s examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

# The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuous function on a closed interval takes on its average value at some point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if $f(x)$ is continuous,a point $c$ exists in an interval $[a,b]$ such that the value of the function at $C$ is equal to the average value of $f(x)$ Oover $[a,b].$ We state this theorem mathematically with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.

# Theorem 5.3: The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

If $f(x)$ is continuous over an interval [a, b], then there is at least one point c∈[a,b] such that

f(c)=1/(b-a)∫ₐᵇf(x)dx.

This formula can also be stated as

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = f(c)(b-a)

## Proof

Since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, by the extreme value theorem (see Maxima and Minima), it assumes minimum and maximum values $-m$ and $M$ ,respectively—on [a, b]. Then, for all $X$ in $[a$ ,b]we have m ≤ f(x) ≤ M . Therefore, by the comparison theorem (see The Definite Integral),we have


m(b - a) ≤ ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx ≤ M(b - a).

Dividing by $b-a$ gives us

m≤(1/(b-a))∫ₐᵇf(x)dx≤M

Since - f(x)dx is a number between $m$ and $M$ and since $f(x)$ is continuous and assumesthe values $m$ and $M$ over $[a,b]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem (see Continuity), there is a number C over $[a,b]$ such that

f(c)=1/(b-a)∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)dx

and the proof is complete.

### Example 5.15

Finding the Average Value of a Function

Find the average value of the function $f(x)=8-2x$ over the interval [0, 4] and find $c$ such that $f(c)$ equals the average value of the function over [O, 4].

### Solution

The formula states the mean value of $f(x)$ is given by

(1/(4-0))∫₀⁴(8-2x)dx

We can see in Figure 5.26 that the function represents a straight line and forms a right triangle bounded by the $x-$ and y-axes. The area of the trangle is A = 1/2(base)( height). We have

A=(1/2)(4)(8)=16

The average value is found by multiplying the area by 1/(4-0) . Thus, the average value of the function is

1/4(16) = 4.

Set the average value equal to $f(c)$ and solve for $C$

8-2c=4, c=2

At $c=2$ $f(2)=4$

![](./images/fK8uReCNm3dPZ7Y4bZ4WhodmARsDKOY13.png)
Figure5.26By the Mean Value Theorem, the continuous

function $f(x)$ takes on its average value at $C$ at least once over a closed interval.

![](./images/fkTbpl4FgH9VDxAOpdck8Em5ubyXSGHO6.png)

5.14 Find the average value of the function f(x) = x/2 over the interval [0, 6] and find c such that $f(c)$ equals the average value of the function over [0, 6].

### Example 5.16

Finding the Point Where a Function Takes on Its Average Value

Given ∫₀³x²dx = 9 , fin such hat $f(c)$ equls h avrae value of $f(x)=x^{2}$ over [0. 3]

### Solution

We are looking for the value of $C$ such that

f(c)=1/(3-0)∫₀³x²dx=1/3(9)=3.

Replacing $f(c)$ with $c^{2}$ we have

c²=3, c=±√3

Since -√3 is outside the interval, take only the positive value. Thus, c = ³√3 (Figure 5.27)

![](./images/fohQgW3b2dhGDYNnUpQpWx4XX3y2ZgfmB.png)
Figure 5.27 Over the interval [0, 3]. the function

$f(x)=x^2$ takes on its average value at c = √3

![](./images/fT3sh4Bd3OyY71inQxBfglZW19dwOy5ZK.png)

5.15 Given ∫₀³ (2x² - 1) dx = 15, find such that $f(c)$ equas the average vale of $f(x)=2x^{2}-1$ over [0, 3].

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and. Antiderivatives

As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration

 Theorem 5.4: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1

If $f(x)$ is continuous over an interval $[a,b]$ and the function $F(x)$ is defined by

F(x)=∫ₐˣf(t)dt,

then F'(x)=f(x) over [a, b].

Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note that we have defined a function, $F(x)$ ,as the definite integral of another function, $f(t)$ ,from the point a to the point $x.$ At

first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like it's a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of $x$ , the definite integral is a number. So the function $F(x)$ returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of $X$

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative. Specifically, it guarantees that any continuous function has an antiderivative

### Proof

Applying the definition of the derivative, we have

F'(x) = lim_(h→0) (F(x+h) - F(x))/h = lim_(h→0) (1/h)[∫ₐˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt - ∫ₐˣ f(t)dt] = lim_(h→0) (1/h)[∫ₐˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt + ∫ₓᵃ f(t)dt] = lim_(h→0) (1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰ f(t)dt

Looking carefully at this last expression, we see (1/h)∫_x^(x+h)f(t)dt is just the average value of the function $f(x)$ over the interval $[ x$, $x+ h]$ Therefore, by The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, there is some number C in $[ x$, $x+ h]$ such that

(1/h)∫ₓˣ⁺ʰf(x)dx=f(c)

In addition, since C is between $X$ and $x+h$ C approaches $X$ as $h$ approaches zero. Also, since $f(x)$ is continuous.we have lim<sub>h→0</sub>f(c) = lim<sub>c→x</sub>f(c) = f(x) Putin althese pieestgether, we have

F'(x) = lim_(h→0) (1/h)∫_x^(x+h) f(x) dx = lim_(h→0) f(c) = f(x)

and the proof is complete

Differentiating the second term, we first let $u(x)=2x$ .Then,

d/dx[∫₀²ˣ t³dt] = 16x³

Thus,

F'(x) = d/dx[-∫₀ˣ t³dt] + d/dx[∫₀²ˣ t³dt] = -x³ + 16x³ = 15x³

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus. After tireless efforts by mathematicians for approximately 500 years, new techniques emerged that provided scientists with the necessary tools to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary orbits. Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could now be handled with simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the three-dimensional motion of objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus

After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of $n$ rectangles, the application of this theorem is straightforward by comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.

## Theorem 5.5: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.

If $f$ is continuous over the interval $[a,b]$ $b]$ b and $F(x)$ is any antiderivative of $f(x)$ ，then

∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)

We often see the notation $F(x)|_a^b$ to denote the expression $F(b)-F(a)$ . We use this vertical bar and associated limits a and $b$ to indicate that we should evaluate the function $F(x)$ at the upper limit (in this case, b), and subtract the value of the function $F(x)$ evaluated at the lower limit (in this case, α).

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem) states that if we can find an

antiderivative for the integrand, then we can evaluate the definite integral by evaluating the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval and subtracting

## Proof

Let P={xᵢ} ， $i=0$ ， $1,...,n$ be a regular partition of $[a,b].$ $b].$ b Then, we can write

F(b)-F(a) = F(xₙ)-F(x₀) = [F(xₙ)-F(xₙ₋₁)]+[F(xₙ₋₁)-F(xₙ₋₂)]+…+[F(x₁)-F(x₀)] = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ[F(xᵢ)-F(xᵢ₋₁)]

Now, we know $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ over $[a,b]$, so by the Mean Value Theorem(see The Mean Value Theorem for $i=0$ ,1..... $Il$ we can find Cᵢ in $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ such that

F(xᵢ) - F(xᵢ₋₁) = F'(cᵢ)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = f(cᵢ)Δx

Then, substituting into the previous equation, we have

F(b)-F(a)=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿf(cᵢ)Δx.

Taking the limit of both sides as 
n → 0 ，we obtain

F(b)-F(a) = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>Σᵢ₌₁ⁿf(cᵢ)Δx = ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

# Example 5.20

Evaluating an Integral with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Use The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 to evaluate.

∫₋₂² (t² - 4)dt

## Solution

Recall the power rule for Antiderivatives.

If y=xⁿ, ∫xⁿdx=xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)+C

Use this rule to find the antiderivative of the function and then apply the theorem. We have

![](./images/fZG07kfCS1YWlal9NsNKA36ygebGCKcfg.png)

### Analysis

Notice that we did not include the $“+C”$ term when we wrote the antiderivative.The reason is that, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the antiderivative with $C=0$ . If we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out. This always happens when evaluating a definite integral.

The region of the area we just calculated is depicted in Figure 5.28. Note that the region between the curve and the $X$ -axis is all below the $X$ -axis. Area is always positive, but a definite integral can still produce a negative number (a net signed area). For example, if this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company is operating at a loss over the given interval.

![](./images/ftkBfRgfbWpkdpMLuZeSyGneW5pp3hwZk.png)

Figure 5.28 The evaluation of a definite integral can produce a negative value, even though area is always positive.

## Example 5.21

Evaluating a Definite Integral Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2

Evaluate the following integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2:

∫₁⁹(x-1)/√x dx

### Solution

First, eliminate the radical by rewriting the integral using rational exponents. Then, separate the numerator terms by writing each one over the denominator

∫₁⁹(x-1)/x<sup>1/2</sup>dx=∫₁⁹(x/x<sup>1/2</sup>-1/x<sup>1/2</sup>)dx

Use the properties of exponents to simplify:

∫₁⁹(x/x¹ᐟ² - 1/x¹ᐟ²)dx = ∫₁⁹(x¹ᐟ² - x⁻¹ᐟ²)dx

Now, integrate using the power rule

∫₁⁹(x¹/² - x⁻¹/²)dx = [(2/3)x³/² - 2x¹/²]|₁⁹ = [(2/3)(27) - 2(3)] - [(2/3)(1) - 2(1)] = 18 - 6 - 2/3 + 2 = 40/3

### A Roller-Skating Race

James and Kathy are racing on roller skates. They race along a long, straight track, and whoever has gone the

farthest after 5 sec wins a prize. If James can skate at a velocity of $f(t)=5+2t$ ft/sec and Kathy can skate at a velocity of g(t) = 10 + cos(πt/2) ft'sec, who is going to win the race?

### Solution

We need to integrate both functions over the interval [O, 5] and see which value is bigger. For James, we want to calculate

∫₀⁵(5+2t)dt

Using the power rule, we have

∫₀⁵(5+2t)dt=(5t+t²)₀⁵=(25+25)=50

Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate

∫₀⁵ 10 + cos(πt/2) dt

We know sint is an antiderivative of cost, so i is reasonable to expet that an antiderivativeof 
cos(πt/2) woulc involve sin(π/2t). However, when we differentiate sin(πt/2). weget π/2cos(π/2)t as areult of thechainrule,so we have to account for this additional coefficient when we integrate.We obtain

∫₀⁵10+cos(π/2t)dt=(10t+(2/π)sin(π/2t))₀⁵=(50+2/π)≈50.6

Kathy has skated approximately 50.6 ft after 5 sec. Kathy wins, but not by much!

5.20 Suppose James and Kathy have a rematch, but this time the official stops the contest after only 3 sec. Does this change the outcome?

# Student PROJECI

A Parachutist in Free Fal

![](./images/fQvvdSIC1KSMSiTAgQegMYkYEE5mvy1rL.png)
Figure 5.30Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body during the

free fall. (credit: Jeremy T. Lock)

Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec)

Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by ν(t) = 32t She continues to accelerate according to this velocity functionuntil she reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.

On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower *belly down” position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec). Using this information, answer the following questions.

1.How long after she exits the aircraft does Julie reach terminal velocity? 2. Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more integrals that represents the distance Julie falls after 30 sec. 3. If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall? 4.Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and for her to slow down during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec. Find the total time Julie spends in the air, from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the ground.

On Julie's second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients herself in the “head down" position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec. Answer these questions based on this velocity:

5.How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case?

6.Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the “belly down” position so she is not moving quite as fast when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 40oo ft, how long does she spend in a free fall before beginning the reorientation? Some jumpers wear “ wingsuits" (see Figure 5.31). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called “flying squirrel suits.") When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec), allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph ,much too fast to land safely.

# 5.4 | Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem

# Learning Objectives

5.4.1 Apply the basic integration formulas

5.4.2Explain the significance of the net change theorem.

5.4.3Use the net change theorem to solve applied problems. 5.4.4 Apply the integrals of odd and even functions.

In this section, we use some basic integration formulas studied previously to solve some key applied problems. It is important to note that these formulas are presented in terms of indefinite integrals. Although definite and indefinite integrals are closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either a number (when the limits of integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables). An indefinite integral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with integration, you will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct approach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind, think carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper notation based on your choice.

# Basic Integration Formulas

Recall theintegration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives and the rule on properties of definite integrals.Let's look at a few examples of how to apply these rules.

# Example 5.23

### Integrating a Function Using the Power Rule

Uuse th poverulet inegrat te funtiore ∫₁⁴√t(1+t)dt

### Solution

The first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule:

∫₁⁴√t(1+t)dt = ∫₁⁴t¹/²(1+t)dt = ∫₁⁴(t¹/²+t³/²)dt

Now apply the power rule:

∫₁⁴(t¹/²+t³/²)dt =(⅔t³/²+⅖t⁵/²)│₁⁴ = [⅔(4)³/²+⅖(4)⁵/²]-[⅔(1)³/²+⅖(1)⁵/²] = 256/15

5.21 Find the definite integral of $f(x)=x^{2}-3x$ over the interval [1, 3]

![](./images/fl2mpRm5P6kr4f6VX8GUhZgUGN0dVUIWm.png)

## The Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new value equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways. The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

### Theorem 5.6: Net Change Theorem

The new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change

F(b) = F(a) + ∫ₐᵇ F'(x) dx

Or
∫ₐᵇF′(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)

Subtracting $F(a)$ from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation. Since they are equivalent formulas, which one we use depends on the application.

The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume, to name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more than one integral. To illustrate, let's apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is displacement

We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction) at 40 mph between $2p.m$ and $4p.m$ , then the car moves south at 30 mph between $4p.m$ . and $5p.m$ We can graph this motionas shown inFiqure 5.32

![](./images/fePgvzub4Y5WacgpM6KNl0ilE1Gtcz5ra.png)
Figure 5.32Thegraph shows speed versus timefor the giver

motion of a car.

Just as we did before. we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance traveled. The net displacement is given by

∫₂⁵ν(t)dt=∫₂⁴40dt+∫₄⁵-30dt=80-30=50

Thus, at $5p.m$ the car is 50 mi north of its starting position. The total distance traveled is given by

∫₂⁵|ν(t)|dt = ∫₂⁴40dt + ∫₄⁵30dt = 80 + 30 = 110

Therefore, between 2 p.m. and $5p.m$ ., the car traveled a total of 110 mi

To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words,the velocity function accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive. To find the total distance traveled by an object, regardless of direction,we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function

### Example 5.24

### Finding Net Displacement

Given a velocity function $v(t)=3t-5$ (in meters per second) for a particle in motion from time $t=0$ to time $t=3$ ，find the net displacement of the particle

### Solution

Applying the net change theorem, we have

∫₀³(3t-5)dt = (3t²/2)-5t|₀³ = (27/2)-15 = -3/2.

The net displacement is -3/2 m (Figure 5.33)

![](./images/fvWB9MIMWgULrFTp8iHdNXla89gVStI3K.png)
Figure 5.33The graph shows velocity versus time for a

particle moving with a linear velocity function

## Example 5.25

### Finding the Total Distance Traveled

Use Example 5.24 to find the total distance traveled by a particle according to the velocity function $v(t)=3t-5$ m/sec over a time interval [O, 3].

### Solution

The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.

To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the t-intercept of the function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for t. Thus,

3t - 5 = 0; 3t = 5; t = 5/3

The two subintervals are [0, 5/3] and [5/3,3] To find the total distance travele, integrate the asolute value of the function. Since the function is negative over the interval 
[0, 5/3], we have |ν(t)| = -ν(t) over that interval Over -3] te funtionis psive so $|v(t)|=v(t)$ Tus we ave

∫₀³|v(t)|dt=∫₀⁵/³-v(t)dt+∫₅/³³v(t)dt=(5t-3t²/2)|₀⁵/³+(3t²/2-5t)|₅/³³=41/6

So, the totl distane raveledis 14/6m

5.22 Find the net displacement and total distance traveled in meters given the velocity function f(t)=1/2eᵗ-2 over the interval [0, 2].

## Applying the Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem can be applied to the flow and consumption of fluids, as shown in Example 5.26

### Example 5.26

### How Many Gallons of Gasoline Are Consumed?

If the motor on a motorboat is started at $t=0$ and the boat consumes gasoline at $5-t^3$ gal/hr for the first hour, how much gasoline is used in the first hour?

### Solution

Express the problem as a definite integral, integrate, and evaluate using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The limits of integration are the endpoints of the interval [O, 1]. We have

∫₀¹(5-t³)dt = (5t-t⁴/4)|₀¹ = 5-1/4 = 4.75.

Thus, the motorboat uses 4.75 gal of gas in 1 hour.

# Example 5.27

Chapter Opener: Iceboats

![](./images/f2mUDGhMGEZ89ie6X3CP28kBwGiInW0PM.png)
Figure 5.34(credit: modification of work by Carter Brown.

Flickr)

As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers (Figure 5.1) can attain speeds of up to five times the wind speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the wind speed Suppose Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been blowing all morning. As Andrew gets his iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first half hour of iceboating, the wind speed increases according to the function ν(t) = 20t+5 .For the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the

wind remains steady at 15 mph . In other words, the wind speed is given by

v(t)={20t+5 for 0≤t≤1/2; 15 for 1/2≤t≤1}

Recalling that Andrew's iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line away from his starting point, how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?

### Solution

To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed. Then

Distance = ∫₀¹ 2v(t)dt

Substituting the expressions we were given for ν(t) ，weget

∫₀¹2ν(t)dt = ∫₀¹⁄₂2ν(t)dt + ∫₁⁄₂¹2ν(t)dt = ∫₀¹⁄₂2(20t+5)dt + ∫₁⁄₂¹2(15)dt = ∫₀¹⁄₂(40t+10)dt + ∫₁⁄₂¹30dt = [20t²+10t]₀¹⁄₂ + [30t]₁⁄₂¹ = (20/4+5)-0+(30-15) = 25.

Andrew is 25 mi from his starting point after 1 hour

5.23 Suppose that, instead of remaining steady during the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind ? starts to die down according to the function $v(t)=-10t+15$ In other words, the wind speed is given by

v(t) = {20t+5 for 0≤t≤1/2; -10t+15 for 1/2≤t≤1}

Under these conditions, how far from his starting point is Andrew after 1 hour?

# Integrating Even and Odd Functions

We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when $X$ is replaced with $-x.$ The graphs of even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain, and the graph of the function is symmetric about the origin.

Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from $-a$ to $a$ ,involve two equal areas, because they are symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly $[-a,a]$ ，evaluate to zero because the areas above and below the $X$ axis are equal.

##  Rule: Integrals of Even and Odd Functions

For continuous even functions such that $f(-x)=f(x)$

∫₋ₐᵃ f(x)dx = 2∫₀ᵃ f(x)dx.

For continuous odd functions such that $f(-x)=-f(x)$

∫₋ₐᵃ f(x)dx = 0

### Example 5.28

### Integrating an Even Function

Integrate h ven uncioon ∫<sub>-2</sub>² (3x⁸ - 2)dx and vefy hath interaton formul foreve functons holes

### Solution

The symmetry appears in the graphs in Figure 5.35. Graph (a) shows the region below the curve and above the $x$ axis. We have to zoom in to this graph by a huge amount to see the region. Graph (b) shows the region above the curve and below the $X$ -axis. The signed area of this region is negative. Both views illustrate the symmetry about the y-axis of an even function.We have

![](./images/fwLkMTAaBkZoEm3WG6QrsNKRbnoDDw2wr.png)

To verify the integration formula for even functions, we can calculate the integral from O to 2 and double it, then check to make sure we get the same answer

∫₀²(3x⁸-2)dx=(x⁹/3-2x)|₀²=512/3-4=500/3

Since 2⋅500/3 = 1000/3 . we have vrfied the formula for even funtions in this particular example

![](./images/fPtvzCHzitOZvRVxqEzmgO3Sscg6IGNKO.png)

Figure 5.35 Graph (a) shows the positive area between the curve and the $x$ -axis,whereas graph (b) shows the negative are between the curve and the $x$ axis.Both views show the symmetry about the y-axis

## Example 5.29

## Integrating an Odd Function

Evaluate the definite integral of the odd function -5sin x over the interval [-π, π]

### Solution

The graph is shown in Fiqure 5.36.We can see the symmetry about the origin by the positive area above the $x$ axis over [-π,0] ,and the negative area below the $x$ -axis over [0, π] Wehave

# 5.5 | Substitution

# Learning Objectives

5.5.1 Use substitution to evaluate indefinite integrals.

5.5.2 Use substitution to evaluate definite integrals.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gave us a method to evaluate integrals without using Riemann sums. The drawback of this method, though, is that we must be able to find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this section we examine a technique, called integration by substitution, to help us find antiderivatives. Specifically, this method helps us find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result of a chain-rule derivative.

At first, the approach to the substitution procedure may not appear very obvious. However, it is primarily a visual taskthat is, the integrand shows you what to do; it is a matter of recognizing the form of the function. So, what are we supposed to se? We arelokin foran inegran o th formn ∫|g(x)|g'(x)dx For example i th integral ∫(x² - 3)³ 2x dx we have f(x) =x², $g(x)=x^{2}-3$ ，and g'(x) = 2x .Then,

f[g(x)]g'(x) = (x²-3)³(2x)

and we see that our integrand is in the correct form.

The method is called substitution because we substitute part of the integrand with the variable $u$ and part of the integrand with du. It is also referred to as change of variables because we are changing variables to obtain an expression that is easier to work with for applying the integration rules

# Theorem 5.7: Substitution with Indefinite Integrals

Let $u=g(x)$ ，where g'(x) is continuous over an interval, let $f(x)$ be continuous over the corresponding range of $g$ ,and let $F(x)$ be an antiderivative of $f(x)$ . Then

∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = ∫f(u)du = F(u)+C = F[g(x)]+C.

## Proof

Let f, g, u, and $F$ be as specified in the theorem. Then

d/dxF(g(x))=F′(g(x))g′(x)=f[g(x)]g′(x)

Integrating both sides with respect to $X$ we see that

∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = F(g(x)) + C

If we now substitute $u=g(x)$ ，and du = g'(x)dx ，we get

∫f[g(x)]g'(x)dx = ∫f(u)du = F(u) + C = F(g(x)) + C

口

Returning to the problem we looked at originally, we let $u=x^{2}-3$ and then $du=2xdx$ . Rewrite the integral in terms of U:

∫(x²-3)³(2x dx) = ∫u³du

Using the power rule for integrals, we have

∫u³ du = u⁴/4 + C

Substitute the original expression for $x$ back into the solution

u⁴/4+C=(x²-3)⁴/4+C.

We can generalize the procedure in the following Problem-Solving Strategy

## Problem-Solving Strategy: Integration by Substitution

1.Look carefully at the integrand and select an expression $g(x)$ within the integrand to set equal to u. Let's select $g(x)$ . such that g'(x) is also part of the integrand. 2. Substitute $ll=g(x)$ and du = g'(x)dx . into the integral. 3.We should now be able to evaluate the integral withrespect to $u$ . If the integral can't be evaluated we need to go back and select a different expression to use as $U$ 4. Evaluate the integral in terms of $u$ 5. Write the result in terms of $X$ and the expression $g(x)$

# Example 5.30

## Using Substitution to Find an Antiderivative

Us sustutio tofin h antideriative ∫6x(3x²+4)⁴dx

### Solution

The first step is to choose an expression for $U$ .We choose $u=3x^{2}+4$ because then $du=6xdx$ andwe already have du in the integrand. Write the integral in terms of $LL$

∫6x(3x²+4)⁴dx=∫u⁴du

Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for $U$ , regardless of what is inside the integrand. Now we can evaluate the integral with respect to u

∫u⁴ du = u⁵/5 + C = ((3x²+4)⁵)/5 + C

### Analysis

We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We should obtain the integrand Picking a value for $C$ of 1, we let y = ↓{3.x2 + 4) + 1. We have

y=(1/5)(3x²+4)⁵+1,

S0

y = (1/5)5(3x²+4)⁴6x = 6x(3x²+4)⁴

This is exactly the expression we started with inside the integrand.

5.25 Use sustituto to ind the anieriative ∫3x²(x³-3)²dx

Sometimes we need to adjust the constants in our integral if they don’t match up exactly with the expressions we are substituting

### Example 5.31

### Using Substitution with Alteratior

Use substition to find ∫z√(z²-5)dz

### Solution

Rewrite the integral as z(2² - 5) dz. Let $u=z^{2}-5$ and $du= 2z$ $dz$ .Now we have a problem because $du=2zdz$ and the original expression has only zdz .We have to alter our expression for $du$ or the integral in uwillbe twice as large asi shouldbe If wemliply both sideof the duequationy 1/2 we can solve this problem. Thus,

u = z² - 5, du = 2z dz, ½du = z dz

Write the integral in terms of $U$ , but pullthe 1/2 outside the integration symbol

∫z(z²-5)¹/²dz=(1/2)∫u¹/²du

Integrate the expression in $U$

(1/2)∫u<sup>1/2</sup>du = (1/2)(u<sup>3/2</sup>/(3/2)) + C = (1/2)(2/3)u<sup>3/2</sup> + C = (1/3)u<sup>3/2</sup> + C = (1/3)(z²-5)<sup>3/2</sup> + C

### Example 5.32

Using Substitution with Integrals of Trigonometric Functions

Usustato ealate h nere ∫sin t / cos³t dt

### Solution

We know the derivative of cost is -sint, so we set u=cos t Then $du=.$ -sintdt. Substituting into the integral, we have

∫sin t/cos³t dt=-∫du/u³

Evaluating the integral, we get

-∫du/u³ = -∫u⁻³ du = (1/2)u⁻² + C

Putting the answer back in terms of $t$ , we get

∫(sin t)/(cos³t)dt = 1/(2u²) + C = 1/(2cos²t) + C.

5.27 Us substio to valte h itegra ∫(cos t)/(sin²t)dt

Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than just multiplying or dividing by a constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When we are done, u should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the original variable in terms of $u$ This technique should become clear in the next example

### Example 5.33

Finding an Antiderivative Using $u$ -Substitution

Use ubstitution to ind the antiderivative ∫x/√(x-1) dx

### Solution

If we let $u=x-1$ .then $du=dx$ .But this does not account for the $X$ in the numerator of the integrand.We need to express $x$ in terms of $u.$ If $u=x-1$ ，then $x=u+1$ . Now we can rewrite the integral in terms of u

∫x/√(x-1) dx=∫(u+1)/√u du=∫√u+1/√u du=∫(u¹⁄²+u⁻¹⁄²) du

Then we integrate in the usual way, replace $u$ with the original expression, and factor and simplify the result Thus,

∫(u^(1/2) + u^(-1/2)) du = (2/3)u^(3/2) + 2u^(1/2) + C = (2/3)(x-1)^(3/2) + 2(x-1)^(1/2) + C = (x-1)^(1/2)[(2/3)(x-1) + 2] + C = (x-1)^(1/2)((2/3)x + 4/3) = (2/3)(x-1)^(1/2)(x+2) + C

5.28 Use substitution to evaluate the indefinite integral ∫cos³t sin t $dt$

## Substitution for Definite Integrals

Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However, using substitution to evaluate a definite integral requires a change to the limits of integration. If we change variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well.

### Theorem 5.8: Substitution with Definite Integrals

Let $ll=g(x)$ and let g' be continuous over an interval $[a,b]$, and let $f$ be continuous over the range of $u=g(x)$ Then,

∫ₐᵇf(g(x))g'(x)dx=∫g(a)g(b)f(u)du

Although we will not formally prove this theorem, we justify it with some calculations here. From the substitution rule for indefinite integrals, if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$ wehave

∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx=F(g(x))+C

Then

∫ₐᵇf[g(x)]g'(x)dx = F|g(x)|ₓ=ₐˣ = F(g(b))-F(g(a)) = F(u)|ᵤ=g(a)ᵤ=g(b) = ∫g(a)g(b)f(u)du

and we have the desired result

# Example 5.34

## Using Substitution to Evaluate a Definite Integral.

Use substitution to evaluate
∫₀¹x²(1+2x³)^5dx

### Solution

Let $u=1+2x^{3}$ ，So $du=6x^{2}dx$ Since the original function includes one factor of $x^2$ and $du=6x^{2}dx$ multiply both sides of the du equation by 1/6. Then,

du = 6x²dx; (1/6)du = x²dx

To adjust the limits of integration, note that when $x=0$ ， $u=1+2(0)=1$ andwhen $x=1$ ， $u=1+2(1)=3$ Then

∫₀¹x²(1+2x³)^5dx=(1/6)∫₁³u⁵du

Evaluating this expression, we get

(1/6)∫₁³ u⁵ du = (1/6)(u⁶/6)|₁³ = 182/9

∫₋₁⁰ y(2y²-3)⁵ dy

### Example 5.35

Using Substitution with an Exponential Function

Usesustuto e alate ∫₀¹xe⁴ˣ²+³dx

### Solution

Let $u=4x^{3}+3$ .Then, $du=8xdx$ To adjust the limits of integration, we note that when $x=0$ x=0 $x= 0$, $u= 3$ $u=3$ =3 and when $x=1$ $u=7$ .So our substitution gives

∫₀¹ xe⁴ˣ²⁺³ dx = (1/8)∫₃⁷ eᵘ du = (1/8)eᵘ|₃⁷ = (e⁷ - e³)/8 ≈ 134.568

5.30Us sustitutin t evaluaae ∫₀¹x²cos(πx³/2)dx

Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral. All of the properties and rules of integration apply independently, and trigonometric functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity before we can apply substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for $u$ after we find the antiderivative, which means that we do not have to change the limits of integration. These two approaches are shown in Example 5.36.

### Example 5.36

### Using Substitution to Evaluate a Trigonometric Integral

USse sustiutin t evalale ∫₀<sup>π/2</sup>cos²θ dθ

### Solution

Let us fistuse trigonometric identity to rewrite the integal The tri identy cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 allows u to rewrite the integral as

∫₀^(π/2)cos²θ dθ=∫₀^(π/2)(1+cos2θ)/2 dθ

Then,

∫₀^π/₂((1+cos2θ)/2)dθ =∫₀^π/₂(1/2+1/2cos2θ)dθ =1/2∫₀^π/₂dθ+1/2∫₀^π/₂cos2θdθ

We can evaluate the first integral as it is, but we need to make a substitution to evaluate the second integral. Le u=2θ Then, du=2dθ ，or 
(1/2)du = dθ  .Also, when 
θ=0 $u=0$ ，and when θ=π/2 ll = π . Expressing the second integral in terms of $U$ , we have

1/2∫₀^π/²dθ + 1/2∫₀^π/²cos2θdθ = 1/2∫₀^π/²dθ + 1/4∫₀^πcosudu = θ/2|₀^π/² + 1/4sinu|₀^π = π/4

# 5.6 | Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic

Functions

# Learning Objectives

5.6.1 Integrate functions involving exponential functions.. 5.6.2 Integrate functions involving logarithmic functions..

Exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model population growth, cell growth, and financial growth, as well as depreciation, radioactive decay, and resource consumption, to name only a few applications. In this section, we explore integration involving exponential and logarithmic functions

## Integrals of Exponential Functions

The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential function,d y = e^λ , is its own derivative and its own integral.

# Rule: Integrals of Exponential Functions

 Exponential functions can be integrated using the following formulas.

∫eˣdx=eˣ+C, ∫aˣdx=aˣ/ln a+C

# Example 5.37

### Finding an Antiderivative of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function e⁻λ

### Solution

Use substitution, setting $u=-x$ and then $du=-1dx$ .Multiply the du equation by -1 , so you now have $-du=dx$ .Then,

∫e⁻ˣdx = -∫eᵘ du = -eᵘ + C = -e⁻ˣ + C

![](./images/fOfczKp6yzOg4V3X5C3d05WfbS2T3TDkv.png)

5.31 Find the antiderivative o the function using substitution: $x^2e^{-2x^3}$

A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on $e$ the same way we treat exponents in polynomial expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can be especially confusing when we have both exponentials and polynomials in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In these cases, we should always double-check to make sure we're using the right rules for the functions we're integrating

## Example 5.38

### Square Root of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function eˣ√(1+eˣ)

### Solution

First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent:

∫eˣ√(1+eˣ)dx=∫eˣ(1+eˣ)^(1/2)dx.

Using substitution, choose $u=1+e^{x}.u=1+e^{x}$ Then, $du=e^{x}dx$ We have (Figure 5.37

∫eˣ(1+eˣ)^(1/2)dx = ∫u^(1/2)du

Then

Figure 5.37The graph shows an exponential function times the square root of an exponential function.

5.32 Find the antiderivative of $e^{x}(3e^{x}-2)^{2}$

## Example 5.39

### Using Substitution with an Exponential Function

Use substution to evaluate the indefite integral ∫3x²e^(2x³)dx

### Solution

Here we choose to let u equal the expression in the exponent on $e$ Let $u=2x^{3}$ and $du=6x^{2}dx$ ..Again, du is off by a constant multiplier; the original function contains a factor of $3x^2$ ,not $6x^2$ . Multiply both sides of the equation by 1/2 So that the integrand in $U$ equals the integrand in $X$ Thus.

∫3x²e²ˣ³dx=(1/2)∫eᵘdu.

Integrate the expression in $U$ and then substitute the original expression in $X$ backinto the $LL$ integral

(1/2)∫eᵘdu=(1/2)eᵘ+C=(1/2)e^(2x³)+C

5.33 aluatethe ndefinie ntegral ∫2x³eˣ⁴dx

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are used in many real-life applications. The number e is often associated with compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections about the derivative. Although the derivative represents a rate of change or a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total growth. Let's look at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application

A pricedemand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the product In general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal pricedemand function is the derivative of the pricedemand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in business to determine the priceelasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether changing production levels would be profitable.

## Example 5.40

## Finding a Price-Demand Equation

Find the pricedemand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is 50 tubes per week at 2.35$ per tube, given that the marginal price—demand function, p'(x） P′(x) p'(x), for $x$ X $X$ number of tubes per week, is given as

$$p'(x)=-0.015e^{-0.01x}.$$

If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?

### Solution

To find the pricedemand equation, integrate the marginal pricedemand function. First find the antiderivative, then look at the particulars. Thus.

p(x) = ∫ -0.015e^(-0.01x) dx = -0.015∫e^(-0.01x)dx

Using substitution, let $u=-0.01x$ and $du=-0.0$l$dx$ Then, divide both sides of the du equation by -0.01 This gives

1.5∫eᵘ du = 1.5eᵘ + C = 1.5e⁻⁰·⁰¹ˣ + C

The next step is to solve for $C$ We know that when the price is 2.35$ per tube, the demand is 50 tubes per week This means

p(50)=1.5e⁻⁰·⁰¹(⁵⁰)+C=2.35

Now, just solve for C:

C = 2.35 - 1.5e⁻⁰·⁵ = 2.35 - 0.91 = 1.44

Thus,

$$p(x)=1.5e^{-0.01x}+1.44.$$

If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be

p(100)=1.5e⁻¹+1.44≈1.99.

The supermarket should charge \$1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week

### Example 5.41

### Evaluating a Definite Inteqral Involving an Exponential Function

Evlate hedenie nere ∫₁²e¹⁻ˣdx

### Solution

Again, substitution is the method to use. Let $u=1-x$ ，so $du=-1dx$ or $-du=dx$ Then ∫e<sup>1-x</sup>dx = -∫e<sup>u</sup>du . Next, change the limits o integrtion Using the equation $u=1-x$ we have

u=1-(1)=0; u=1-(2)=-1

The integral then becomes

∫₁²e^(1-x)dx = -∫₀⁻¹e^u du = ∫₋₁⁰e^u du = e^u|₋₁⁰ = e⁰ - e⁻¹ = -e⁻¹ + 1

### See Figure 5.38

## Example 5.42

### Growth of Bacteria in a Culture

Suppose the rate of growth of bacteria in a Petri dish is given by $q(t)=3^{n}$ ，where $t$ is given in hours and $q(t)$ is given in thousands of bacteria per hour. If a culture starts with 10,000 bacteria, find a function $Q(t)$ that gives the number of bacteria in the Petri dish at any time t. How many bacteria are in the dish after 2 hours?

### Solution

We have

Q(t) = ∫3ᵗ dt = 3ᵗ/ln3 + C.

Then, at $t=0$ we have Q(0) = 10 = 1/ln3 + C ，so C≈9.090 and we get

Q(t) = 3ᵗ/ln3 + 9.090

At time $t=2$ ，we have

Q(2) = 3²/ln3 + 9.090 = 17.282

After 2 hours, there are 17,282 bacteria in the dish.

![](./images/fuNOHVVsQYSVnw91S1z68pvaGPRez2aiR.png)

5.35From Example 5.42, suppose the bacteria grow at a rate of $q(t)=2^n$ .Assume the culture still starts with 10,000 bacteria. Find $Q(t)$ .How many bacteria are in the dish after 3 hours?

# Example 5.43

### Fruit Fly Population Growth

 Suppose a population of fruit flies increases at a rate of $g(t)=2e^{0.02s}$ , in flies per day. If the initil population of fruit flies is 100 flies, how many flies are in the population after 10 days?

### Solution

Let $G(t)$ represent the number of flies in the population at time t. Applying the net change theorem, we have

G(10) = G(0) + ∫₀¹⁰ 2e⁰·⁰²ᵗ dt = 100 + [2/0.02 e⁰·⁰²ᵗ]₀¹⁰ = 100 + [100e⁰·⁰²ᵗ]₀¹⁰ = 100 + 100e⁰·² - 100 ≈ 122

There are 122 flies in the population after 10 days.

![](./images/fiw96dO1zsh6aeYcxrOq6poBhRwuv9HdO.png)

5.36Suppose the rate of growth of the fly population is given by $g(t)=e^{0.01r}$ ，and the initial fly population is 100 flies. How many flies are in the population after 15 days?

### Example 5.44

### Evaluating a Definite Inteqral Using Substitution

Evaluate the definite integral using substitution
:∫₁²e<sup>1/x</sup>/x²dx

### Solution

This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on $E$ as a power of $x$, then bring the $x^{2}$ in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent. We have

∫₁²e^(1/x)/x²dx=∫₁²e^(x⁻¹ )x⁻²dx

Let $u=x^{-1}$ ，the exponent on $e$ Then

du = -x⁻²dx
-du = x⁻²dx.

Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads



### Solution

First factor the 3 outside the integral symbol. Then use the $u^{-1}$ rule. Thus,
∫(3/(x-10))dx = 3∫(1/(x-10))dx = 3∫(du/u) = 3ln|u| + C = 3ln|x-10| + C, x≠10

See Figure 5.39

5.38 Find the atiderivative of 1/(x+2)

### Example 5.46

### Finding an Antiderivative of a Rational Function

Find h anideivaive f (2x³+3x)/(x⁴+3x²)

### Solution

This can be rewritten as (2x²+ 3x(x4+ 3x2) dx.Use substitution.Let $u=x^{4}+3x^{2}$ ，then $du=4x^{3}+6x$ .Alter du by factoring out the 2. Thus.

du=(4x³+6x)dx=2(2x³+3x)dx, 1/2du=(2x³+3x)dx.

Rewrite the integrand in u:

Then we have

∫(2x³+3x)(x⁴+3x²)-¹dx=½∫u⁻¹du

1/2∫u⁻¹du = 1/2ln|u|+C = 1/2ln|x⁴+3x²|+C

## Example 5.47

Finding an Antiderivative of a Logarithmic Function

Find the antiderivative of the log function log₂x

### Solution

Follow the format in the formula listed in the rule on integration formulas involving logarithmic functions. Based on this format, we have

∫log₂xdx=(x/ln2)(lnx-1)+C

![](./images/fAOhXBlRIvNAfEpKP13oK3Bc0mccV1mXq.png)

5.39 Find the antiderivative of log₃x

Example 5.48 is a definite integral of a trigonometric function. With trigonometric functions, we often have to apply a trigonometric property or an identity before we can move forward. Finding the right form of the integrand is usually the key to a smooth integration.

## Example 5.48

Evaluating a Definite Integral

Fin hedeie neraloe ∫₀^(π/₂) sin x/(1 + cos x) dx

### Solution

We need substitution to evaluate this problem. Let u=1+cosx ，so du = sin.x dx. Rewrite the integral in terms of $u$ , changing the limits of integration as well. Thus
u = 1 + cos(0) = 2, u = 1 + cos(π/2) = 1

Then

5.7.1 Integrate functions resulting in inverse trigonometric functions

In this section we focus on integrals that result in inverse trigonometric functions. We have worked with these functions before.Recall from Functions and Graphs that trigonometric functions are not one-to-one unless the domains are restricted. When working with inverses of trigonometric functions, we always need to be careful to take these restrictions into account. Also in Derivatives, we developed formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. The formulas developed there give rise directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.

## Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions.

Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along with these formulas, we use substitution to evaluate the integrals. We prove the formula for the inverse sine integral

# Rule: Integration Formulas Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functionse

3|8.1

### Proof

Let y = sin⁻¹(x/a) Then asin y=x Now let's use implicit differentiation. We obtair

d/dx(asin y) = d/dx(x); acos y(dy/dx) = 1; dy/dx = 1/(acos y)

For -n/2≤y≤π/2 ， cos y≥0 .Thus, applyingthe Pythagorean identity sin²y+cos²y=1 ，wehave f' .This gives

1/(a cos y) = 1/(a√(1 - sin²y)) = 1/√(a² - a²sin²y) = 1/√(a² - x²)

Then for -a ≤ x ≤ a ,and generalizing to $U$ , we have

∫(1/√(a²-u²))du=sin⁻¹(u/a)+C

We can go directly to the formula for the antiderivative in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions, and then evaluate the definite integral. We have

Applying the formula with $a=2$ ，we obtain

∫dx/√(4-9x²)=(1/3)∫du/√(4-u²).

∫dx/√(4 - 9x²) = (1/3)∫du/√(4 - u²) = (1/3)sin⁻¹(u/2) + C = (1/3)sin⁻¹(3x/2) + C

∫₀^√(3)/₂ 1/√(1-u²) du = sin⁻¹u|₀^√(3)/₂ = [sin⁻¹(√(3)/₂)] - [sin⁻¹(0)] = π/3

### Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions

There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out -1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function

### Example 5.52

Finding an Antiderivative Involving the Inverse Tangent Function.

Find a antidervatie of ∫1/(1+4x²)dx

### Solution

Comparing this problem with the formulas stated in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions, the integrand looks similar to the formula for tan⁻¹u+C So we use substitution letting $u=2x$ ，then $du=2dx$ and $1/2du=dx$ Then, we have

(1/2)∫1/(1 + u²)du = (1/2)tan⁻¹u + C = (1/2)tan⁻¹(2x) + C

# Introduction

The Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel. When Lake Mead, the reservoir behind the dam, is full, the dam withstands a great deal of force. However, water levels in the lake vary considerably as a result of droughts and varying water demands. Later in this chapter, we use definite integrals to calculate the force exerted on the dam when the reservoir is full and we examine how changing water levels affect that force (seeExample 6.28).

Hydrostatic force is only one of the many applications of definite integrals we explore in this chapter. From geometric applications such as surface area and volume, to physical applications such as mass and work, to growth and decay models, definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand and model the world around us

# 6.1 | Areas between Curves

6.1.1 Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to the. independent variable 6.1.2 Find the area of a compound region 6.1.3 Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to the dependent variable

In Introduction to Integration,we developed the concept of the definite integral to calculate the area below a curve on a given interval. In this section, we expand that idea to calculate the area of more complex regions. We start by finding the area between two curves that are functions of $x$ ,beginning with the simple case in which one function value is always greater than the other. We then look at cases when the graphs of the functions cross. Last, we consider how to calculate the area between two curves that are functions of $y$

# Area of a Region between Two Curves

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions over an interval $[ a$, $b]$ such that f(x)≥g(x) on $[a,b].$ We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fc3SwVieNzrUszkgRscsrhlTOfsDl8Gaa.png)
Figure 6.2 The area between the graphs of two functions

$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,on the interval [a, b].

As we did before, we are going to partition the interval on the $x$ -axis and approximate the area between the graphs of the functions with rectangles. So, for i = 0 $i=0$ $i=0,1,2,...,n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b].$ Then, for $i=1$ , 2.... 71 ， choose a point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ , and on each interval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ construct a rectangle that extends vertically from $g(x_i^*)$ to $f(x_i^*$ ). Figure 6.3(a) shows the rectangles when $x_i^*$ is selected to be the left endpoint of the interval and $n=10$ .Figure 6.3(b) shows a representative rectangle in detail.

Use this calculator (http://www.openstax.org/l/2o_CurveCalc) to learn more about the areas between two curves.

![](./images/fo6eBTz759AvQXulvvdi3MTgwlLn6Tcdg.png)

Figure 6.3 (a)We can approximate the area between the graphs of two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,with rectangles. (b) The area of a typical rectangle goes from one curve to the other.

The height of each individual rectangle is $f( x_{i}^{* }$ $) - g( x_{i}^{* }$ ) and the width of each rectangle is Δx .Adding the areas of all the rectangles, we see that the area between the curves is approximated by

A≈∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ[f(xᵢ*)-g(xᵢ*)]Δx

This is a Riemann sum, so we take the limit as n→∞ and we get

A=limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ[f(xᵢ*)-g(xᵢ*)]Δx=∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx

These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

## Theorem 6.1: Finding the Area between Two Curves

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions such that f(x)≥g(x) over an interval $[a,b]$ Let $R$ denote the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ,below by the graph of $g(x)$ ,and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A=∫[f(x)-g(x)]dx

We apply this theorem in the following example.

## Example 6.1

Finding the Area of a Region between Two Curves 1

If $R$ is the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=x+4$ and below by the graph of the function g(x)=3-x/2 over the interval [1, 4], find the area of region $R$

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure.

Figure 6.4 A region between two curves is shown where one

curve is always greater than the other

We have

A =∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx =∫₁⁴[(x+4)-(3-x/2)]dx=∫₁⁴[(3x/2)+1]dx =[(3x²/4)+x]|₁⁴=(16-7/4)=57/4

The area of theregion is 57/4 units²

6.1If $R$ is the region bounded by the graphs of the functions f(x) = x/2 + 5 and g(x) = x + 1/2 over the interval [1, 5], find the area of region $R$

In Example 6.1, we defined the interval of interest as part of the problem statement. Quite often, though, we want to define our interval of interest based on where the graphs of the two functions intersect. This is illustrated in the following example.

### Example 6.2

Finding the Area of a Region between Two Curves 2.

If $R$ is the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=9-(x/2)^{2}$ and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=6-x$ find the area of region $R$

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure

![](./images/ff0sbFeNKdQHH3gNEe5d9zoD80s4LW1ak.png)
Figure 6.5 This graph shows the region below the graph of

$f(x)$ and above the graph of $g(x)$

We first need to compute where the graphs of the functions intersect. Setting $f(x)=g(x)$ ，we get

f(x) = g(x) 9-(x/2)² = 6-x 9-x²/4 = 6-x 36-x² = 24-4x x²-4x-12 =0 (x-6)(x+2) =0.

The graphs of the functions intersect when $x=6$ or $x=-2$ ，so we want to integrate from -2 to 6.Since f(x)≥g(x) for -2 ≤ x ≤ 6 we obtain

A =∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx =∫₋₂⁶[9-(x/2)²-(6-x)]dx=∫₋₂⁶[3-x²/4+x]dx =[3x-x³/12+x²/2]|₋₂⁶=64/3

The area of the region is 64/3 units$^2$

6.2 If $R$ is the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=x$ and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=x^{4}$ ，find the area of region $R$

## Areas of Compound Regions

So far, we have required f(x)≥g(x) over the entire interval of interest, but what if we want to look at regions bounded by the graphs of functions that cross one another? In that case, we modify the process we just developed by using the absolute value function.

## Theorem 6.2: Finding the Area of a Region between Curves That Cross

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be continuous functions over an interval [a, $b].$ Let $R$ denote the region between the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ,and be bounded on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A = ∫ₐᵇ|f(x)-g(x)| dx

In practice, applying this theorem requires us to break up the interval $[a,b]$ and evaluate several integrals, depending on which of the function values is greater over a given part of the interval. We study this process in the following example

# Example 6.3

Finding the Area of a Reqion Bounded by Functions That Cross

If $R$ is the region between the graphs of the functions f(x)=sin x and g(x) = cos x over the interval[O,π] find the area of region $R$

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure

![](./images/fItEDxiA17KMiNuX3dscG08sBMGVQaY8d.png)
Figure 6.6 The region between two curves can be broken into

two sub-regions.

The graphs of the functions intersect at x=π/4 .For x∈[0, π/4], cos x ≥ sin x ，SO

|f(x)-g(x)|=|sin x-cos x|=cos x-sin x

On the other hand, for x∈[π/4,π], sin x ≥ cos x SO

|f(x)-g(x)| = |sin x - cos x| = sin x - cos x

Then

A = ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>|f(x) - g(x)|dx = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup>|sin x - cos x|dx = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π/4</sup>(cos x - sin x)dx + ∫<sub>π/4</sub><sup>π</sup>(sin x - cos x)dx = [sin x + cos x]|<sub>0</sub><sup>π/4</sup> + [-cos x - sin x]|<sub>π/4</sub><sup>π</sup> = (√2 - 1) + (1 + √2) = 2√2

The area of the region is 2V2 units2

6.3If $R$ is the region between the graphs of the functions f(x)=sin x and g(x) = cos x over the interval [π/2, 2π] ,find the area of region $R$

# Example 6.4

Finding the Area of a Complex Region

Consider the region depicted in Figure 6.7. Find the area of $k$

![](./images/f4Wq5KUpLt258wEgnvDGhtCp0siGI1fcC.png)
Figure 6.7 Two integrals are required to calculate the area of

this region.

### Solution

As with Example 6.3, we need to divide the interval into two pieces. The graphs of the functions intersect at $x=1$ (set $f(x)=g(x)$ and solve for $x$ ), so we evaluate two separate integrals: one over the interval [O, 1] and one over the interval [1, 2]

Over the interval[0,1].the region is bounded above by $f(x)=x^{2}$ and below by the $X$ -axis. so we have

A₁=∫₀¹x²dx=x³/3|₀¹=⅓

Over the interval [1, 2], the region is bounded above by $g(x)=2-x$ and below by the $X$ -axis, so we have

A₂=∫₁²(2-x)dx=[2x-x²/2]|₁²=½

Adding these areas together, we obtain

![](./images/fgNzrNq9MS6V7u7G0VDmRDFLk5PAwDx2G.png)

A = A₁ + A₂ = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6

The area of the region is 5/6 units$^{2}$

6.4Consider the region depicted in the following figure.Find the area of $R$

# Regions Defined with Respect to y

In Example 6.4, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of $y$ ,instead of as functions of x'²

Review Figure 6.7. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function $y=f(x)=x^{2}$ .We could just as easily solve this for λ and represent the curve by the function x=v(y)=√y (Note that x = -√y is also a valid representation of the function $y=f(x)=x^{2}$ as a function of $J$ . However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function $y=g(x)=2-x$ but could just as easily be represented by the function $x=u(y)=2-y$ When the graphs are represented as functions of $y$ ，we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function. Therefore, if we integrate with respect to $y$ we need to evaluate one integral only. Let's develop a formula for this type of integration

Let $u(y)$ and $v(y)$ be continuous functions over an interval $[ c$, $d]$ such that u(y)≥v(y) for all y ∈ [c, $d]$ We want to find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fNyai3LK9ExROE7p0WK6ro9LtZScsk9gD.png)
Figure 6.8We can find the area between the graphs of two

functions, $u(y)$ and ν(y)

This time, we are going to partition the interval on the $y$ -axis and use horizontal rectangles to approximate the area between the functions. So, for $i=0$ 1, 2..., $n$ ，let Q = {yᵢ} be a regular partition of $[ c$, $d] .$ Then, for $i=1$ ,2..... $n$ choose a point y ∈[yᵢ₋₁,yᵢ] , then over each interval $[y_{i-1},y_i]$ construct a rectangle that extends horizontally from v(yᵢ#) ) to $u(y_i^{*}$ ). Figure 6.9(a) shows the rectangles when $y_i^*$ is selected to be the lower endpoint of the interval and $n=10$ Fiqure 6.9(b) shows a representative rectangle in detail.

Figure 6.9 (a) Approximating the area between the graphs of

two functions, $u(y)$ and ν(y) ,with rectangles. (b) The area of a typical rectangle.

The height of each individual rectangle is Δy and the width of each rectangle is u(yᵢ#)-v(yᵢ# ).Therefore, the area between the curves is approximately

A ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ[u(yᵢ*) - v(yᵢ*)]Δy

This is a Riemann sum, so we take the limit as n→∞ .obtaining


A = lim(n→∞) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ [u(yᵢ*) - v(yᵢ*)]Δy = ∫cᵈ [u(y) - v(y)]dy 

These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

## Theorem 6.3: Finding the Area between Two Curves, Integrating along the y-axis

Let $u(y)$ and ν(y) be continuous functions such that u(y)≥v(y) for all y∈[c,d] Let $R$ denote the region bounded on the right by the graph of ιι(y) ，on the left by the graph of $v(y$ ).and above and below by the lines $y=d$ and $y=c$ ,respectively. Then, the area of $R$ is given by

A=∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>[u(y)-v(y)]dy

Let's revisit Example 6.4, only this time let's integrate with respect to $y$ Let $R$ be the region depicted in Figure 6.10. Find the area of $R$ by integrating with respect to $y$

![](./images/fUXe8W4LxxKNi2n4ekZHpNIpXrd4GVTTg.png)
Figure 6.10 The area of region $R$ can be calculated using

 one integral only when the curves are treated as functions of $y$

### Solution

We must first express the graphs as functions of $y$ As we saw at the beginning of this section, the curve on the left can be represented by the function x=v(y)=√y and the curve on the right can be represented by the function $x=u(y)=2-y$

Nowwe have to determine the limits of integration.The region isbounded below by the $X$ axis, so the lower limit of integration is $y=0$ . The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the point (1, 1), so the upper limit of integration is $y=1$ .Thus, we have $[ c$, $d] = [ 0$, 1]

Calculating the area of the region, we ge

# 6.2 | Determining Volumes by Slicing


5|0

In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section, we use definite integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches-slicing, disks, and washersfor finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.

# Volume and the Slicing Method

Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a three-dimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a rectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height: $V=lwh$ .The formulas for the volume of a sphere V=(4/3)πr³ a cone V=(1/3)πr²h, and a pyramid (V = (1/3)Ah) have also bee itroduced. Although some of these formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration.

We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as a soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.

We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the cylinder Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 6.11 is an example of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross section by the height of the cylinder: V = A·h . In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V = πr²h

![](./images/ff5HX1VM6VW8kxDRCkPMGTzR9f9ga9aSn.png)
Two-dimensional cross sectior Three-dimensional cylinder

Figure 6.11Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others

If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula fon its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the solid into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together. The slices should all be parallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the solid $S$ shown in Figure 6.12, extending along the $x$ -axis.

![](./images/fun3GNbElbNam2FRySlC8IQe95cq05GES.png)
Figure 6.12A solid with a varying cross-section

We want to divide $S$ into slices perpendicular to the $x$ -axis.Aswe see later in the chapter, there may be timeswhen we want to slice the solid in some other direction—say, with slices perpendicular to the $y$ -axis. The decision of which way to slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the $X$ -axis

Because the cross-sectional area is not constant, we let $A(x)$ represent the area of the cross-section at point $x$ Now let P = {x₀ ， $x_{1}$ .... 2x-1≤g(x)≤x²-2x+3 be a regular partition of [a, $b$ and for $i=1$ , 2,.11, let $S_{i}$ represent the slice of $S$ stretching from $x_{i- 1}$ to xᵢ The following figure shows the sliced solid with $n=3$

![](./images/f9and1O39ZGfYheymKF34VUfBOqto8GBG.png)
Figure 6.13The solid $S$ has been divided into three slice

perpendicular to the $x$ -axis

Finally, for i = 1 $i=1$ $i= 1$, 2,…,n ，let $x_i^*$ be an arbitrary point in $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ .Then the volume of slice $S_{i}$ can be estimated by V(Sᵢ) ≈ A(xᵢ*) Δx Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the entire solid $S$ can be approximated by

V(S)≈Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ A(xᵢ*)Δx.

By now, we can recognize this as a Riemann sum, and our next step is to take the limit as n→∞ . Then we have

V(S)=lim(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿA(xᵢ*)Δx=∫ₐᵇA(x)dx

The technique we have just described is called the slicing method. To apply it, we use the following strategy.

### Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Volumes by the Slicing Method

1. Examine the solid and determine the shape of a cross-section of the solid. It is often helpful to draw a picture if one is not provided. 2.Determine a formula for the area of the cross-section. 3.Integrate the area formula over the appropriate interval to get the volume.

Recall that in this section, we assume the slices are perpendicular to the $x$ -axis. Therefore, the area formula is in terms of $x$ and the limits of integration lie on the $x$ -axis. However, the problem-solving strategy shown here is valid regardless of how we choose to slice the solid.

# Example 6.6

Deriving the Formula for the Volume of a Pyramid

We know from geomety that the formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = (1/3)Ah . If the pyramid has a square base, this becomes V = (1/3)a²h , where a denotes the length of one side of the base. We are going to use the slicing method to derive this formula

### Solution

We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider the pyramic shown in Figure 6.14,oriented along the $x$ -axis.

![](./images/fV3cKFkq5wIbLRdUR96gCszKPweZGDXgQ.png)
Figure 6.14 (a) A pyramid with a square base is oriented along the $x$ axis. (b) A two-dimensional view of the

pyramid is seen from the side

We first want to determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. We know the base is a square, so the cross-sections are squares as well (step 1). Now we want to determine a formula for the area of one of these crosssectional squares. Looking at Figure 6.14(b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have

s/a = x/h or s = ax/h

Therefore, the area of one of the cross-sectional squares is

A(x)=s²=(ax/h)² (step 2)

Then we find the volume of the pyramid by integrating from 0tan h $h$ (step 3）

V=∫₀ʰA(x)dx=∫₀ʰ(ax/h)²dx=(a²/h²)∫₀ʰx²dx=[(a²/h²)(1/3x³)]|₀ʰ=(1/3)a²h

This is the formula we were looking for

6.6Use the slicing method to derive the formula V=(1/3)πr²h for the volume of a circular cone

## Solids of Revolution

If a region in a plane is revolved around a line in that plane, the resulting solid is called a solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fDLlThX53XQG5ToY5g5NHlXeXaGF0g7en.png)
Figure 6.15 (a) This is the region that is revolved around the x-axis. (b) As the region begins to revolve around the axis, it sweeps out a

solid of revolution. (c) This is the solid that results when the revolution is complete.

Solids of revolution are common in mechanical applications, such as machine parts produced by a lathe. We spend the rest of this section looking at solids of this type. The next example uses the slicing method to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution

## Example 6.7

### Using the Slicing Method to find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution

Use the slicing method to find the volume of the solid of revolution bounded by the graphs of $f(x)=x^{2}-4x+5$ $x=1$ ， and $x=4$ ，and rotated about the $X$ -axis.

### Solution

Using the problem-solving strategy, we first sketch the graph of the quadratic function over the interval [1, 4] as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fQLwGKMBbEDoGY5btngftGAqZe1Xfwn0b.png)
Figure 6.16A region used to produce a solid of revolution.

Next, revolve the region around the $x$ -axis, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fyA8CaNRCiEyUCQNMP3LmDsUhh1QGbSZZ.png)

in Figure 6.16 about the $x$ -axis.

Since the solid was formed by revolving the region around the $X$ -axis, the cross-sections are circles (step 1). The area of the cross-section, then, is the area of a circle, and the radius of the circle is given by $f(x)$ .Use the formula for the area of the circle:

A(x) = πr² = π[f(x)]² = π(x²-4x+5)² (step 2)

The volume, then, is (step 3)

V =∫ₐᵇA(x)dx =∫₁⁴π(x²-4x+5)²dx =π∫₁⁴(x⁴-8x³+26x²-40x+25)dx =π((x⁵/5)-2x⁴+(26x³/3)-20x²+25x)|₁⁴ =(78/5)π

The volume is 78π/5

6.7Use the method of slicing to find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region between the graph of the function $f(x)=1/x$ andthe $X$ -axis over the interval [1, 2] around the $A$ -axis. See the following figure

![](./images/fux0XWh65CEUU44sS45UKw1arwwK2ye1k.png)

# The Disk Method

When we use the slicing method with solids of revolution, it is often called the disk method because, for solids of revolution, the slices used to over approximate the volume of the solid are disks. To see this, consider the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region between the graph of the function $f(x)=(x-1)^{2}+1$ and the $X$ -axis over the interval [1, 3] around the $x$ -axis. The graph of the function and a representative disk are shown in Figure 6.18(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 6.18(c) and (d)

![](./images/ftHx4GVW0GSGPwZkXxN4tLP9ChQCme7fx.png)

(d) the solid of revolution.

We already used the formal Riemann sum development of the volume formula when we developed the slicing method. We know that

V=∫ₐᵇA(x)dx

The only difference with the disk method is that we know the formula for the cross-sectional area ahead of time; it is the area of a circle. This gives the following rule

### Rule:The Disk Method

Let $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define. $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ below by the

X axis, on the left by the line $X=a$ ,and on the right by the line $x=b$ . Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the X -axis is given by

V=∫ₐᵇπ[f(x)]²dx

The volume of the solid we have been studying (Figure 6.18) is given by
V =∫ₐᵇπ[f(x)]²dx =∫₋₁³π[(x-1)²+1]²dx=π∫₋₁³[(x-1)⁴+2(x-1)²+1]dx =π[1/5(x-1)⁵+2/3(x-1)³+x]|₋₁³=π[(32/5+16/3+3)-(-32/5-16/3-1)]=412π/15 units³

Let's look at some examples.

# Example 6.8

Using the Disk Method to Find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution 1

Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region between the graph of f(x) = √x and the $X$ -axis over the interval [1, 4] around the $x$ -axis.

# Solution

The graphs of the function and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fVEdznIV20o8bmYoo9lT4OggmknRHsENs.png)
Figure 6.19 (a) The function f(x) = √x over the interval [1, 4]. (b) The solid of revolution

obtained by revolving the region under the graph of $f(x)$ about the $x$ -axis.

## We have

V =∫ₐᵇπ[f(x)]²dx =∫₁⁴π[√x]²dx=π∫₁⁴x dx =π/2x²|₁⁴=15π/2.

The volume is (15π)/2 units3.

![](./images/fmp3nw6mU1kDO3ai4OIX1G2d70AmSGqyU.png)

6.8Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region between the graph of f(x)=√(4-x) andthe $X$ -axis overthe interval [0, 4] around the $X$ -axis.

So far, our examples have all concerned regions revolved around the $X$ -axis, but we can generate a solid of revolution by revolving a plane region around any horizontal or vertical line. In the next example, we look at a solid of revolution that has been generated by revolving a region around the $y$ -axis. The mechanics of the disk method are nearly the same as when the $x$ axis is the axis of revolution, but we express the function in terms of $y$ and we integrate with respect to $y$ as well. This is summarized in the following rule.

### Rule: The Disk Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis

Let $g(y)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of $g(y)$ ，on the left by the $y$ -axis,belowby the line $y=c$ ,and above by the line $y=d$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolutior formed by revolving $Q$ around the $y$ -axis is given by

V=∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>π[g(y)]²dy

The next example shows how this rule works in practice.

# Example 6.9

Using the Disk Method to Find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution 2

Let $R$ be the region bounded by the graph of g(y)=√(4-y) and the $y$ -axis over the y-axis interval [0, 4] Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating $R$ around the $y$ -axis

### Solution

Figure 6.20 shows the function and a representative disk that can be used to estimate the volume. Notice that since we are revolving the function around the $y$ -axis, the disks are horizontal, rather than vertical

![](./images/fkaRRxAXszA5IRbH4594IQIYQS3stPZna.png)
Figure 6.20 (a) Shown is a thin rectangle between the curve of the function g(y)=√(4-y)

and the $y$ -axis. (b) The rectangle forms a representative disk after revolution around the $y$ -axis.

The region to be revolved and the full solid of revolution are depicted in the following figure

Figure 6.21 (a) The region to the left of the function g(y)=√(4-y) over the $y$ -axis interval

[0, 4]. (b) The solid of revolution formed by revolving the region about the $y$ -axis.

To find the volume, we integrate with respect to $y$ .We obtain

V=∫cᵈπ[g(y)]²dy=∫₀⁴π[√(4-y)]²dy=π∫₀⁴(4-y)dy=π[4y-y²/2]|₀⁴=8π.

The volume is 8π units3

![](./images/fy0wHGg6YgQsZ8noS7qPaCfRmfKek4L0s.png)

6.9Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region between the graph of $g(y)=y$ and the $y$ -axis over the interval [1, 4] around the $y$ -axis.

# The Washer Method

Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of revolution. Sometimes this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to the axis of revolution. In other cases, cavities arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region between the graphs of two functions. A third way this can happer is when an axis of revolution other than the $X$ -axis or $y$ -axis is selected

When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are not disks, but washers (disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x) = √x and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=1$ over the interval [1, 4]. When this region is revolved around the $X$ -axis, the result is a solid with a cavity in the middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function and a representative washer are shown in Figure 6.22(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 6.22(c) and (d).

![](./images/fYOSSkkwCg7tgpgBdtcqT0GV4ShoGIGyN.png)
Figure 6.22 (a) A thin rectangle in the region between two curves. (b) A

representative disk formed by revolving the rectangle about the $x$ -axis. (c) The region between the curves over the given interval. (d) The resulting solid of revolution.

The cross-sectional area, then, is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. In this case,

A(x)=π(√x)²-π(1)²=π(x-1)

Then the volume of the solid is

V = ∫ₐᵇA(x)dx = ∫₁⁴π(x-1)dx = π[(x²/2)-x]|₁⁴ = (9/2)π units³

Generalizing this process gives the washer method

## Rule: The Washer Method

Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous, nonnegative functions such that f(x)≥g(x) over $[a,b].$ Let $R$ denote the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ，below by the graph of $g(x)$ , on the left by the line $x=a$ , and on

the right by the line $x=b$ .Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the $x$ -axis is given by

V = ∫ₐᵇ π[(f(x))² - (g(x))²]dx

# Example 6.10

### Using the Washer Method

Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x$ and below by the graph of $g(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1, 4] around the $x$ -axis

### Solution

The graphs of the functions and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure

![](./images/fX12fLPzOaNr5pYqQVf61HgmmGVLVNGar.png)

$g(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1, 4]. (b) Revolving the region about the $x$ -axis generates a solid of revolution with a cavity in the middle

We have

V = ∫ₐᵇπ[(f(x))²-(g(x))²]dx = π∫₁⁴[x²-(1/x)²]dx = π[x³/3 + 1/x]|₁⁴ = (81π)/4 units³

6.10Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of f(x) = √x and $g(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1, 3] around the $X$ -axis.

As with the disk method, we can also apply the washer method to solids of revolution that result from revolving a region around the y-axis. In this case, the following rule applies.

# Rule:The Washer Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis

Suppose ιι(y) and $v(y)$ are continuous, nonnegative functions such that v(y) ≤ u(y) for y ∈ [c, $d] .$ Let $Q$ denote the region bounded on the right by the graph of $lu(y)$ ， on the left by the graph of $v(y$ ).below by the line $y=c$ and above by the line $y=d$ Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the $y$ -axis is given by

V = ∫cᵈπ[(u(y))² - (v(y))²]dy.

Rather than looking at an example of the washer method with the $y$ -axis as the axis of revolution, we now consider an example in which the axis of revolution is a line other than one of the two coordinate axes. The same general method applies, but you may have to visualize just how to describe the cross-sectional area of the volume.

# Example 6.11

### The Washer Method with a Different Axis of Revolution

Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by $f(x)=4-x$ and below by the $x$ axis over the interval [O,4]around the line $y=-2$

### Solution

The graph of the region and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure

![](./images/fRyvI63kHYg5BXVpicM9CwO0oKUBq0GWL.png)
Figure 6.24 (a) The region between the graph of the function $f(x)=4-x$ and the $x$ -axis

over the interval [O, 4]. (b) Revolving the region about the line $y=-2$ generates a solid of revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.

We can’t apply the volume formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the

coordinate axes.However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by $f(x)+2$ ,which simplifies to

$$f(x)+2=(4-x)+2=6-x.$$

The radius of the inner circle is $g(x)=2$ .Therefore, we have

V = ∫₀⁴ π[(6 - x)² - 2²]dx = π∫₀⁴(x² - 12x + 32)dx = π[x³/3 - 6x² + 32x]|₀⁴ = 160π/3 units³

# 6.3 | Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

# Learning Objectives

6.3.1 Calculate the volume of a solid of revolution by using the method of cylindrical shells

6.3.2 Compare the different methods for calculating a volume of revolution.

In this section, we examine the method of cylindrical shells, the final method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution. We can use this method on the same kinds of solids as the disk method or the washer method: however. with the disk and washer methods, we integrate along the coordinate axis parallel to the axis of revolution. With the method of cylindrical shells, we integrate along the coordinate axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. The ability to choose which variable of integration we want to use can be a significant advantage with more complicated functions. Also, the specific geometry of the solid sometimes makes the method of using cylindrical shells more appealing than using the washer method. In the last part of this section, we review all the methods for finding volume that we have studied and lay out some guidelines to help you determine which method to use in a given situation.

# The Method of Cylindrical Shells

Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region $R$ ，bounded above by the graph of a function $y=f(x)$ ，below by the $x$ -axis, and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ respectively, as shown in Figure 6.25(a). We then revolve this region around the y-axis, as shown in Figure 6.25(b). Note that this is different from what we have done before. Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of $x$ were revolved around the $x$ -axis or a line parallel to it.

![](./images/fek9sEuN84lfzAVY41uCiccigQwVW9aTL.png)
(a) A region bounded by the graph of a function of $x.$ (b) The solid of revolution formed when the

region is revolved around the $y$ -axis.

As we have done many times before, partition the interval $[ a$, $b]$ using a regular partition, P = {x₀, x₁, …, xₙ and, for $i=1$ ,2..... 71 ，choose a point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ . Then, construct a rectangle over the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ of height $f(x_i^*$ ）and width Δx A representative rectangle is shown in Figure 6.26(a). When that rectangle is revolved around the y-axis, instead of a disk or a washer, we get a cylindrical shell, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/feuYdFfrAOKv7hRXqC58OwqkZb127vH5V.png)
Fiqure 6.26 (a) A representative rectangle. (b) When this rectangle is revolved around the y-axis.the result is a cylindrica

shell. (c) When we put all the shells together, we get an approximation of the original solid.

To calculate the volume of this shell, consider Fiqure 6.27.

![](./images/f5IrVzYfZ7QYDB7BNNYpMGM47EyhIWNB0.png)
Fiqure 6.27 Calculating the volume of the shell

The shell is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections are annuli (ringshaped regions sntiall, cires with hole in the enter), wth oute radius $x_i$ and inner radius $x_{i-1}$ . Thus, the cross-sectional area is 
32) πxᵢ² - πxᵢ₋₁² .The height of the cylinder is $f(x_i^*$ ). Then the volume of the shell is

V_shell = f(xᵢ*)(πxᵢ² - πxᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ² - xᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁).

Note that xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁=Δx ，so we have

Vₛₕₑₗₗ = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2)Δx

Furthermore, (xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2 is both themidoint of the iteal $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ and the averae raius of the shel and we an approximate this by $x_i^*$ .We then have

Vshell ≈ 2πf(xᵢ*)xᵢ*Δx

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate (Figure 6.28

![](./images/ftVXNl5pNfZO7OfP3mwihUMZSBCffsQ0W.png)
Figure 6.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate

In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height $f(x_{I}^{*}$ ) width 2πxᵢ* ，and thickness Δx (Figure 6.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get

Vshell ≈ f(xᵢ*)(2πxᵢ*)Δx

which is the same formula we had hefore

To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain

V ≈ Σ_(i=1)^n (2πxᵢ* f(xᵢ*) Δx)

Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2πxf(x) .Taking the limit as n→∞ gives us

V = lim┬(n→∞)⁡∑_(i=1)^n▒(2πxᵢ*f(xᵢ*)Δx) = ∫_a^b▒(2πxf(x))dx

Thisleads to the followingrulefor the method of cylindrical shells.

# Rule:The Method of Cylindrical Shells

Let $f(x)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$ ，below by the $X$ axis, on the left by the line $x=a$ ,and on the right by the line $x=b$ . Then the volume of the solid of revolution

formed by revolving $R$ around the y-axis is given by

V=∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx

Now let's consider an example.

## Example 6.12

### Solution

First we must graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫ₐᵇ(2πxf(x))dx = ∫₀²(2πx(2x-x²))dx = 2π∫₀²(2x²-x³)dx = 2π[(2x³/3)-(x⁴/4)]|₀² = (8π/3) units³

As with the disk method and the washer method, we can use the method of cylindrical shells with solids of revolution, revolved around the $x$ -axis,when we want to integrate with respect to $y$ .The analogous rule for this type of solid is giver here.

### Rule: The Method of Cylindrical Shells for Solids of Revolution around the x-axis

Let $g(y)$ be continuous and nonnegative. Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of $g(y)$ on the left by the $y$ -axis, below by the line $y=c$ ，and above by the line $y=d$ .Then, the volume of the solid of

revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the $X$ -axis is given by

V=∫c^d(2πyg(y))dy

### Example 6.14

## The Method of Cylindrical Shells for a Solid Revolved around the $X$ -axis

Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of g(y)=2√y and on the left by the $y$ -axis for y∈[0,4 .Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ around the $X$ -axis.

### Solution

First, we need to graph the region $Q$ and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fOMySItVaR3pVgvOsCEzcTSgE2T7SQlIm.png)

Figure 6.31 (a) The region $Q$ to the left of the function $g(y)$ over the interval [0, 4]. (b) The solid of revolution generated by revolving $Q$ around the $x$ -axis.

Label the shaded region $Q$ .Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫c^d (2πyg(y))dy = ∫0^4 (2πy(2√y))dy = 4π∫0^4 y^(3/2)dy = 4π[2y^(5/2)/5]|0^4 = 256π/5 units³

6.14 Define $Q$ as the region bounded on the right by the graph of $g(y)=3/y$ and on the left by the $y$ -axis for y [1, 3]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $Q$ aroundthe λ -axis

For the next example, we look at a solid of revolution for which the graph of a function is revolved around a line other than one of the two coordinate axes. To set this up, we need to revisit the development of the method of cylindrical shells. Recall that we found the volume of one of the shells to be given by


Vshell = f(xᵢ*)(πxᵢ² - πxᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ² - xᵢ₋₁²) = πf(xᵢ*)(xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁) = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2)(xᵢ - xᵢ₋₁).

This was based on a shell with an outer radius of $X_{i}$ and an inner radius of $x_{i-1}$ . If, however, we rotate the region around a line other than the $y$ -axis, we have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we rotate the region around the line $x=-k$ ，where $k$ is some positive constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is $x_{i}+k$ and theinner radius of the shell is $x_{i-1}+k$ .Substituting these terms into the expression for volume, we see that when a plane region is rotated around the line $x=-k$ the volume of a shell is given by

Vshell = 2πf(xᵢ*)((xᵢ+k)+(xᵢ₋₁+k)/2)((xᵢ+k)-(xᵢ₋₁+k)) = 2πf(xᵢ*)(((xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2)+k)Δx

As before, we ntice that (xᵢ + xᵢ₋₁)/2 is te midpint fthe interal $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ and can be approximatedby $x_{I}^{200}$ . Then, the approximate volume of the shell is

V<sub>shell</sub>≈2π(x<sub>i</sub>*+k)f(x<sub>i</sub>*)Δx

The remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that

V=∫ₐᵇ(2π(x+k)f(x))dx

We could also rotate the region around other horizontal or vertical lines.such as a yertical line in the right half plane.In each case, the volume formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the X -term in the integral must be replaced with an expression representing the radius of a shell. To see how this works, consider the following example.

## Example 6.15

### A Region of Revolution Revolved around a Line

Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x$ and below by the $x$ axis over the interva [1.2].Find thevolume of the solid ofrevolution formed by revolving $R$ around the line $x=-1$

## Solution

First, graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution,as shown in the following figure

6.15Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ and below by the $X$ -axis over the interval[O, 1]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the line $x=-2$

For our final example in this section, let's look at the volume of a solid of revolution for which the region of revolution is bounded by the graphs of two functions.

# Example 6.16

A Region of Revolution Bounded by the Graphs of Two Functions

Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x)=√x and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=1/x$ over the interval [1, 4]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving $R$ around the $y$ -axis.

## Solution

First, graph the region $R$ and the associated solid of revolution,as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fu1Foqi6LU9ooSF1xvQPBz8EK0VQogwDe.png)
Figure 6.33 (a) The region $R$ between the graph of $f(x)$ and the graph of $g(x)$ over the interval [1, 4]. (b)

The solid of revolution generated by revolving $R$ around the $y$ -axis

Note that the axis of revolution is the $y$ -axis, so the radius of a shell is given simply by X We don't need to make any adjustments to the λ -term of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by $f(x)-g(x)$ ，SO in this case we need to adjust the $f(x)$ term of the integrand. Then the volume of the solid is given by

V = ∫₁⁴(2πx(f(x)-g(x)))dx = ∫₁⁴(2πx(√x - 1/x))dx = 2π∫₁⁴(x³/² - 1)dx = 2π[(2x⁵/²/5) - x]|₁⁴ = (94π/5) units³

6.16 Define $R$ as the region bounded above by the graph of $f(x)=x$ and below by the graph of $g(x)=x^2$ over the interval [O, 1]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around the $y$ -axis.

## Which Method Should We Use?

We have studied several methods for finding the yolume of a solid of reyolution. but how do we know which method to use? It often comes down to a choice of which integral is easiest to evaluate. Figure 6.34 describes the different approaches for solids of revolution around the $x$ -axis.It's up to you to develop the analogous table for solids of revolution around the y-axis.

Comparing the Methods for Finding the Volume of a Solid Revolution around the $X$ -axis


Hours Past Midnight|No. of Burgers Sold

Let's take a look at a couple of additional problems and decide on the best approach to take for solving them

## Example 6.17

## Selecting the Best Method

For each of the following problems, select the best method to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by revolving the given region around the $x$ -axis,and set up the integral to find the volume (do not evaluate the integral)

a.The region bounded by the graphs of $y= x$, $y= 2- x$, and the $x$ -axis

b.The region bounded by the graphs of $y=4x-x^{2}$ and the $x$ -axis.

### Solution

a.First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown

![](./images/fN9GYvaGPpDGWsvPxzZaKNTkyo6nfS0R3.png)
Figure 6.35(a) The region $R$ bounded by two lines and the $x$ -axis. (b) The solid of

revolution generated by revolving $R$ about the $x$ -axis

Looking at the region, if we want to integrate with respect to $X$ ,we would have to break the integral into two pieces, because we have different functions bounding the region over [0, 1] and [1, 2]. In thi case,using the disk method,we would have

V = ∫₀¹(πx²)dx + ∫₁²(π(2-x)²)dx.

If we used the shell method instead, we would use functions of $y$ to represent the curves, producing

V = ∫₀¹(2πy[(2-y)-y])dy = ∫₀¹(2πy[2-2y])dy

Neither of these integrals is particularly onerous, but since the shell method requires only one integral, and the integrand requires less simplification, we should probably go with the shell method in this case.

b.First,sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown

![](./images/fu8bkaZab1kUhXdkzMkdG0XrESgeGmW3g.png)
Figure 6.36(a) The region $R$ between the curve and the $x$ -axis. (b) The solid of

revolution generated by revolving $R$ about the $x$ -axis.

Looking at the region,it would be problematic to define a horizontal rectangle: the region is bounded on the left and right by the same function. Therefore, we can dismiss the method of shells. The solid has no cavity in the middle, so we can use the method of disks. Then

V=∫₀⁴π(4x-x²)²dx.

6.17Select the best method to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by revolving the given region around the $x$ -axis, and set up the integral to find the volume (do not evaluate the integral): the region bounded by the graphs of $y=2-x^{2}$ and $y=x^{2}$

# 6.4 | Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

# Learning Objectives

6.4.1 Determine the length of a curve, $y=f(x)$ .between two points

6.4.2 Determine the length of a curve, $x=g(y)$ between two points.

6.4.3 Find the surface area of a solid of revolution.

In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.

We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of $x$ ,then we examine the same process for curves defined as functions of $y$ . (The process is identical, with the roles of $X$ and $y$ reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of this concept.

# Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x)

In previous applications of integration, we required the function $f(x)$ to be integrable, or at most continuous. However, for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for $f(x)$ .Here, we require $f(x)$ to be differentiable, and furthermore we require its derivative, f'(x) ,to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)

Let $f(x)$ be a smooth function defined over $[a,b]$ .We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point (a, $f(a)]$ to the point $( b$, $f( b) )$ We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For $i=0$ ,1, 2..., n, let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b].$ Then, for i = 1 $i=1$ $i=1,2,...,n$ ,construct a line segment from the point (x; 1 $(x_{i-1}$ $( x_{i- 1}$, $f( x_{i- 1}) )$ to the point $(x_i,f(x_i)).$ Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 6.37 depicts this construct for $n=5$

![](./images/feSPFdzgG4gSU2P0PqndBgVqa2gVXiQFl.png)
Figure 6.37We can approximate the length of a curve by

adding line segments.

To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in horizonta distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is given by Δx The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyᵢ=f(xᵢ)-f(xᵢ₋₁) to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ ,as shown in Figure 6.38. Note that some (or all) Δyᵢ may benegative.

![](./images/fgzUmdMBeyXYqk2PVeOVqzsboyTx0xGsT.png)
Figure 6.38 A representative line segment approximates the

curve over the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is 
√((Δx)² + (Δyᵢ)²)  We can also write this as Δx√(1+(Δyᵢ/Δx)²)  .Now, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point xᵢ* ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] such that f'(xᵢ*) Δyᵢ/Δx . Then the length of the line segment is given by Δx√(1+[f'(xᵢ*)]²) Adding up the lengths of all the line segments, we get

Arc Length ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ√(1 + [f'(xᵢ*)]²)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ wehave

Arc Length = lim_(n→∞) Σ_(i=1)^n √(1 + [f'(xᵢ*)²]Δx = ∫_a^b √(1 + [f'(x)]²) dx

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

## Theorem 6.4: Arc Length for y = f(x)

Let $f(x)$ be a smooth function over the interval $[a,b].$ Then the arc length of the portion of the graph of $f(x)$ from the point $(a,f(a))$ to the point $( b$, $f( b) )$ is given by

Arc Length = ∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²) dx

Note that we are integrating an expression involving f'(x) , so we need to be sure f'(x) is integrable. This is why we require $f(x)$ to be smooth. The following example shows how to apply the theorem.

## Example 6.18

## Calculating the Arc Length of a Function of x

Let $f(x)=2x^{3/2}$ .Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [0, 1]. Round the answer to three decimal places.

### Solution

Wehave f'(x) = 3x¹/² ，So 
23) [f'(x)]² = 9x Then,the arc length is

Arc Length = ∫ₐᵇ√(1 + [f'(x)]²) dx = ∫₀¹√(1 + 9x) dx

Substitute $u=1+9x$ Then, $du= 9$ $dx$ .When $x=0$ ，then $u=1$ ，and when $x=1$ ，then $u=10$ .Thus

Arc Length = ∫₀¹√(1+9x)dx = (1/9)∫₀¹√(1+9x)9dx = (1/9)∫₁¹⁰√u du = (1/9)*(2/3)u^(3/2)|₁¹⁰ = (2/27)[10√10 - 1] ≈ 2.268 units

 6.18 Let $f(x)=(4/3)x^{3/2}$ Calculaethe arc lengtho the graphof $f(x)$ over the iterval 0, 11. Round the

answer to three decimal places

Although it is nice to have a formula for calculating arc length, this particular theorem can generate expressions that are difficult to integrate. We study some techniques for integration in Introduction to Techniques of Integration (http://cnx.org/content/m53654/latest/). In some cases, we may have to use a computer or calculator to approximate the value of the integral.

### Example 6.19

Using a Computer or Calculator to Determine the Arc Length of a Function of $x$

Let $f(x)=x^2$ . Calculate the arc length of the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval [1, 3]

### Solution

We have 
f′(x)=2x SO [f'(x)]²=4x² .Then the arc length is given by

Arc Length=∫ₐᵇ√[b]{1+[f'(x)]²} dx=∫₁³∛(1+4x²) dx.

Using a computer to approximate the value of this integral, we get

∫₁³∛(1+4x²)dx≈8.26815.

# Arc Length of the Curve. $x=g(y)$

We have just seen how to approximate the length of a curve with line segments. If we want to find the arc length of the graph of a function of $y$ ,we can repeat the same process, except we partition the $y$ -axis instead of the $x$ axis. Figure 6.39 shows a representative line segment.

![](./images/fh6tBwou0yrbN8me7WEy3ntl55lzgsxlA.png)
Figure 6.39 A representative line segment over the interval

$[y_{i-1},y_i]$

Then the length of the line segment is √((Δy)² + (Δxᵢ)²)  ,which can also be written as Δy√(1+((Δxᵢ)/(Δy))²) If we now follow the same development we did earlier, we get a formula for arc length of a function $x=g(y)$

### Theorem 6.5: Arc Length for x = g(y)

Let $g(y)$ be a smooth function over an interval [c, d]. Then, the arc length of the graph of $g(y$ )from the point $( c$, $g( c) )$ to the point $( d$, $g( d) )$ is given by

Arc Length=∫cᵈ√(1+[g'(y)]²)dy

## Example 6.20

Calculating the Arc Length of a Function of y.

Let $g(y)=3y^{3}$ .Calculate the arc length of the graph of $g(y)$ over the interval [1, 2].

### Solution

We have g'(y)=9y², so[g'(y)]²=81y⁴ Then the arc length is

Arc Length=∫cd√(1+[g'(y)]²)dy=∫₁²√(1+81y⁴)dy

Using a computer to approximate the value of this integral, we obtain

## Area of a Surface of Revolution

The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution. Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects such as cubes or bricks, the surface area of the object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Let $f(x)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval $[a,b].$ $b].$ $b].$ We wish to find the surface area of the surface of revolution created by revolving the graph of $y=f(x)$ around the $x$ axis as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/f7euGGtfz2lh4s3NMmvlCYH70dbteqt1b.png)
Figure 6.40 (a) A curve representing the function $f(x)$ - (b) The surface of revolution

formed by revolving the graph of $f(x)$ around the $x$ -axis.

As we have done many times before, we are going to partition the interval $[a,b]$ and approximate the surface area by calculating the surface area of simpler shapes. We start by using line segments to approximate the curve, as we did earlier in this section. For $i=0$ , 1., 2.... 72 ，let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ Then, for $i=1$ , 2..., n, construct a line segment from the point (x;- 1 $(x_{i-1}$ $( x_{i- 1}$, $f( x_{i- 1}) )$ to the point $( x_{i}$, $f( x_{i}) ) .$ Now, revolve these line segments around the $X$ -axis to generate an approximation of the surface of revolution as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/ftE1m1OveGWBg13ZgOxml2GTra8RNUGVc.png)
Figure 6.41 (a) Approximating $f(x)$ with line segments. (b) The surface of revolution

formed by revolving the line segments around the $x$ axis.

(think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). A piece of a cone like this is called a frustum of a cone

To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area, $S$ of the frustum (the area of just the slanted outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or bottom faces). Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the radi of the wide end and the narrow end of the frustum, respectively, and let $I$ be the slant height of the frustum as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fM600z8b7nGlIRvVUvNCFgmDzgBfMqXMz.png)
Figure 6.42 A frustum of a cone can approximate a small part

of surface area.

We know the lateral surface area of a cone is given by

Lateral Surface Area πrs

where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cone and $s$ is the slant height (see the following figure)

![](./images/f8WrGQgDUyEBm5zbW0gADMLg8Sl8AyrMw.png)

πrs.

Since a frustum can be thought of as a piece of a cone, the lateral surface area of the frustum is given by the lateral surface area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone (the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the following figure).

![](./images/f7fsmFG4TCR7uERtMIGv2dbpZpMqiPVvP.png)
Figure 6.44 Calculating the lateral surface area of a frustum

of a cone.

The cross-sections of the small cone and the large cone are similar triangles. so we see tha

r₂/r₁=(s−l)/s

Solving for S ，we get

r₂/r₁ = (s-l)/s; r₂s = r₁(s-l); r₂s = r₁s - r₁l; r₁l = r₁s - r₂s; r₁l = (r₁-r₂)s; r₁l/(r₁-r₂) = s

Then the lateral surface area (SA) of the frustum is

S = (Lateral SA of large cone) - (Lateral SA of small cone) = πr₁s - πr₂(s-l) = πr₁(r₁l/(r₁-r₂)) - πr₂(r₁l/(r₁-r₂) - l) = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + πr₂l = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + (πr₂l(r₁-r₂))/(r₁-r₂) = (πr₁²l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) + (πr₁r₂l)/(r₁-r₂) - (πr₂²l)/(r₁-r₂) = (π(r₁² - r₂²)l)/(r₁-r₂) = (π(r₁-r₂)(r₁+r₂)l)/(r₁-r₂) = π(r₁+r₂)l.

Let's now use this formula to calculate the surface area of each of the bands formed by revolving the line segments around the $x$ axis. A representative band is shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fDL3d8IucDcmyEleW8eaKBwfDf3kmlFqn.png)
Figure 6.45A representative band used for determining

surface area.

Note that the slant height of this frustum is just the length of the line segment used to generate it. So, applying the surface area formula, we have

S=π(r₁+r₂)l=π(f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ))√(Δx²+(Δyᵢ)²)=π(f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ))Δx√(1+(Δyᵢ/Δx)²) 

 Now, as we did in the development of the arc length formula, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to select $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ such that f'(xᵢ*) Δyᵢ/Δx .This gives us

S=π(f(xᵢ₋₁)+f(xᵢ))Δx√(1+(f′(xᵢ*))²)

Furthermore, since $f(x)$ is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a point xᵢ**∈[xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ such that $f(x_{i}^{**})=(1/2)[f(x_{i-1})+f(x_{i})]$, so we get

S=2πf(xᵢ**)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²) 

Then the approximate surface area of the whole surface of revolution is given by

Surface Area≈Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πf(xᵢ*)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²)

This almost looks like a Riemann sum, except we have functions evaluated at two different points, $x_{I}^{24}$ and $x_{i}^{**}$ ，over the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ . Although we do not examine the details here, it turns out that because $f(x)$ is smooth, if we let n→∞ ,the limit works the same as a Riemann sum even with the two different evaluation points. This makes sense intuitively. Both $x_{I}^{*}$ and $x_i^{***}$ are in the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ ,so it makes sense that as n→∞ ，both $x_l^{*}$ and x; approach $X$ .Those of you who are interested in the details should consult an advanced calculus text Taking the limit as n→∞ ，we get

Surface Area=lim_(n→∞)Σ_(i=1)^n 2πf(xᵢ**)Δx√(1+(f'(xᵢ*))²)=∫_a^b(2πf(x)√(1+(f'(x))²))dx

As with arc length, we can conduct a similar development for functions of $y$ to get a formula for the surface area of surfaces of revolution about the $y$ -axis. These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

## Theorem 6.6: Surface Area of a Surface of Revolution

Let $f(x)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval $[a,b]$ Then, the surface area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of $f(x)$ around the $X$ -axis is given by

Surface Area=∫ₐᵇ(2πf(x)√(1+(f'(x))²))dx

Similarly, let $g(y)$ be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval $[c,d].$ Then, the surface area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the graph of $g(y)$ around the $y$ -axis is given by

Surface Area = ∫<sub>c</sub><sup>d</sup>(2πg(y)<sup>4</sup>√(1+(g'(y))²))dy

# Example 6.21

Let f(x) = √x over the interval [1, 4]. Find the surface area of the surface generated by revolving the graph of $f(x)$ around the $x$ -axis. Round the answer to three decimal places.

# Solution

The graph of $f(x)$ and the surface of rotation are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fVZXiZYG0Ba1XPeM62GlogHgXXrH0pLIO.png)
Figure 6.46 (a) The graph of $f(x)$ . (b) The surface of revolution.

We have f(x) = √x Then, f'(x) = 1/(2√x) and (f'(x))² = 1/(4x) .Then,

Surface Area=∫ₐᵇ(2πf(x)|√1+(f'(x))²)dx =∫₁⁴(2π√x√1+1/(4x))dx =∫₁⁴(2π|x+1/4|)dx

Let $u=x+1/4$ .Then, $du=dx$ When $x= 1$, $u= 5/ 4$ ，and when $x= 4$, $u= 17/ 4$ This gives us

∫₁⁴(2π√(x+¼))dx = ∫₅/₄¹⁷/₄2π√u du = 2π[⅔u³/²]|₅/₄¹⁷/₄ = (π/6)[17√17-5√5]≈30.846

Let f(x)=y=∛(3x) Consider the portion of the curve where 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 . Find the surface area of the surface generated by revolving the graph of $f(x)$ around the $y$ -axis.

### Solution

Notice that we are revolving the curve around the $y$ -axis, and the interval is in terms of $y$ ，so we want to rewrite the function as a function of y. We get $x=g(y)=(1/3)y^{3}$ . The graph of $g(y)$ and the surface of rotation are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fg4ofwqgyeuPCoWGfy8KqoYo9WHUxYri3.png)
Figure 6.47 (a) The graph of $g(y)$ . (b) The surface of revolution

We have g(y= 1/3)y $g(y)=(1/3)y^{3}$ $g(y)=(1/3)y^{3}$, so g'(y) = y² g'(y) = y² g(y = y2 and (g'(y))² = y⁴ .Ther

Surface Area = ∫_(c)^(d) (2πg(y)√(1+(g'(y))²))dy = ∫_(0)^(2) (2π(1/3y³)√(1+y⁴))dy = (2π/3)∫_(0)^(2) (y³√(1+y⁴))dy

Let $u=y^{4}+1$ . Then $du=4y^{3}dy$ .When $y= 0$, $u= 1$ ,and when $y= 2$, $u= 17$ . Then

In this section, we examine some physical applications of integration. Let's begin with a look at calculating mass from a density function. We then turn our attention to work, and close the section with a study of hydrostatic force

# Mass and Density

We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we consider a thin rod or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the $x$ -axis, with the left end of the rod at $x=a$ and the right end of the rod at $x=b$ (Figure 6.48). Note that although we depict the rod with some thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes we assume the rod is thin enough to be treated as a one-dimensional object.

![](./images/fkTLvp90lPTPmt0XMMCvVbnoKmHda5xkD.png)
Figure 6.48We can calculate the massof a thin rod oriented

along the $x$ -axis by integrating its density function.

If the rod has constant density ρ ,given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is just the product of the density and the length of the rod: 
(b - a)ρ  .If the density of the rod is not constant, however, the problem becomes a little more challenging. When the density of the rod varies from point to point, we use a linear density function, ρ(x) ，to denote the density of the rod at any point, $x$ Let ρ(x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for $i=0$ , 1, 2..... $n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$, b $b]$, and for $i=1$ , 2.... $n$ choose an arbitrary point xᵢ* ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ] Fiqure 6.49 shows a representative segment of the rod

![](./images/fYalF0C2Gr4whdLVa9kidPOKLTEzxqBec.png)
Figure 6.49 A representative segment of the rod

Themass $m_{i}$ of the segment of the rod from $x_{i-1}$ to $x_i$ is approximated by

mᵢ≈ρ(xᵢ*)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)=ρ(xᵢ*)Δx.

Adding the masses of all the segments gives us an approximation for the mass of the entire rod

m = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ mᵢ ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ ρ(xᵢ*)Δx.

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as 
n → 0 ,we get an expression for the exact mass of the rod:

m = lim_(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿρ(xᵢ*)Δx = ∫ₐᵇρ(x)dx.

We state this result in the following theorem.

# Theorem 6.7: Mass-Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object

Given a thin rod oriented along the $x$ -axis over the interval $[a,b]$, let ρ(x) denote a linear density function giving the density of the rod at a point $x$ in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by

m = ∫ₐᵇ ρ(x) dx

We apply this theorem in the next example.

# Example 6.23

Calculating Mass from Linear Density

Consider a thin rod oriented on the $x$ -axis over the interval [π/2,π] .If the density of the rod is given by ρ(x)=sin x what is the mass of the rod?

### Solution

Applying Equation 6.10 directly, we have.

m=∫ₐᵇρ(x)dx=∫_(π/2)ᴨsin x dx=-cos x|_(π/2)ᴨ=1

![](./images/fR8Po81OiAybMTdLSY7gOkL3vNPpEevAz.png)

6.23 Consider a thin rod oriented on the $X$ -axis over the interval [1, 3]. If the density of the rod is given by ρ(x)=2x²+3 ,what is the mass of the rod?

We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius $r$ .As with the rod we looked at in the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a two-dimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further assume the density varies only along the disk's radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the $xy$ -plane, with the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of $x$ denoted ρ(x) .We assume ρ(x) is integrable. Because density is a function of $x$ ,we partition the interval from [0, $r]$ along the $x$ -axis. For $i=0$ , 1, 2...., n,let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval [O, r], and for $i=1$ , 2.... $n$ ，choose an arbitrary point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ I. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a representative washer are depicted in the following figure

![](./images/fhs1gAPi6fVwnW9wY16HUCcv1QZstrbdn.png)
Figure 6.50 (a) A thin disk in the xy-plane. (b) A representative washer.

We now approximate the density and area of the washer to calculate an approximate mass, $m_{i}$ Note that the area of the washer is given by

Aᵢ=π(xᵢ)²-π(xᵢ₋₁)²=π[xᵢ²-xᵢ₋₁²]=π(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)=π(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)Δx.

You may recall that we had an expression similar to this when we were computing volumes by shells. As we did there, we use $x_{i}^{* }$ ≈(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)/2 to approximate the average radius of the washer. We obtain

Aᵢ=π(xᵢ+xᵢ₋₁)(Δx)≈2πxᵢ*Δx

Using ρ(xᵢ*) ) to approximate the density of the washer, we approximate the mass of the washer by

mᵢ≈2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx

Adding up the masses of the washers, we see the mass HIl of the entire disk is approximated by

m=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢ≈∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx

We again recognize this as a Riemann sum, and take the limit as n→∞ .This gives us

m=lim(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ2πxᵢ*ρ(xᵢ*)Δx=∫₀ʳ2πxρ(x)dx.

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

## Theorem 6.8: Mass-DensityFormula of a Circular Object

Let ρ(x) be an integrable function representing the radial density of a disk of radius $r$ . Then the mass of the disk is given by

m = ∫₀ʳ2πxρ(x)dx.

# Example 6.24

### Calculating Mass from Radial Density

Let ρ(x) = √x represent the radial density of a disk. Calculate the mass of a disk of radius 4

### Solution

Applying the formula, we find

m=∫<sub>0</sub><sup>r</sup>2πxρ(x)dx=∫<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>2πx√xdx=2π∫<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>x<sup>3/2</sup>dx=2π(2/5)x<sup>5/2</sup>|<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>=(4π/5)[32]=128π/5

6.24 Let ρ(x) = 3x + 2 represent the radial density of a disk. Calculate the mass of a disk of radius 2.

# Work Done by a Force.

We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a push or pull on an object When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of as the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be expressed as the product of force and distance.

In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds. In the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 m/sec$^2$ . Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule. Both are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared (kg⋅m²/s²)

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.

Suppose we have a variable force $F(x)$ that moves an object in a positive direction along the $x$ axis from point $a$ to point $b$ .To calculate the work done, we partition the interval $[ a$, $b]$ and estimate the work done over each subinterval. So, fon $i=0$ ,1, 2.., n, let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$, and for $i=1$ , 2..... $n$ ，choose an arbitrary point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ 1. To calculate the work done to move an object from point $x_{i-1}$ to point $x_{i}$, we assume the force is roughly constant over the interval, and use $F( x_{i}^{* }$ ) to approximate the force. The work done over the interval $[ x_{i- 1}$, $x_{i}]$ ，then, is given by

Wᵢ≈F(xᵢ*)(xᵢ-xᵢ₋₁)=F(xᵢ*)Δx

Therefore, the work done over the interval $[a,b]$ is approximately

W=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿWᵢ≈∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿF(xᵢ*)Δx.

Taking the limit of this expression as n→∞ gives us the exact value for work

W = lim_(n→∞) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ F(xᵢ*)Δx = ∫ₐᵇ F(x)dx.

Thus, we can define work as follows.

### Definition

If a variable force $F(x)$ moves an object in a positive direction along the $x$ axis from point a to point $b$ , then the work done on the object is

W=∫ₐᵇF(x)dx.

Note that if F is constant, the integral evaluates to F⋅(b-a) = F⋅d ,which is the formula we stated at the beginning of this section.

Now let's look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a block attached to a horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and compresses. Although in the real world we would have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting,we ignore friction here and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the system is said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium position the block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that $x=0$ corresponds to the equilibrium position (see the following figure)

![](./images/frTtX0rLgkyYiP0sdGia4k48ilbIqQUmN.png)
Figure 6.51 A block attached to a horizontal spring at

equilibrium, compressed, and elongated.

According to Hooke's law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by $F(x)=kx$ ，for some constant $k$ .The value of $k$ depends on the physical characteristics of the spring. The constant $k$ is called the spring constant and is always positive. We can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or elongate a spring, as shown in the following example.

# Example 6.25

### The Work Required to Stretch or Compress a Spring

Suppose it takes a force of $10N$ (in the negative direction) to compress a spring $0.2m$ from the equilibriun position. How much work is done to stretch the spring $0.5m$ from the equilibrium position?

### Solution

First find the spring constant. $k$ .When $x=-0.2$ weknow $F(x)=-10$ .SC

F(x) = kx, -10 = k(-0.2), k = 50

and $F(x)=50x$ Then, to calculate work, we integrate the force function, obtaining

W=∫ₐᵇF(x)dx=∫₀⁰·⁵50x dx=25x²|₀⁰·⁵=6.25

The work done to stretch the spring is 6.25 J

6.25Suppose it takes a force of 8 lb to stretch a spring 6 in. from the equilibrium position.How much work is done to stretch the spring 1 ft from the equilibrium position

# Work Done in Pumping.

Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a little more complicated than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape and size of the tank. In addition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to move a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the water from the top of the tank.

We examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank, then look at a couple of examples using tanks of different shapes. Assume a cylindrical tank of radius $4m$ and height $10m$ is filled to a depth of 8m .How much work does it take to pump all the water over the top edge of the tank?

The first thing we need to do is define a frame of reference. We let $x$ represent the vertical distance below the top of the tank. That is, we orient the $X$ -axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive (see the following figure)

![](./images/ff7kTyNbaB6mKNoDiqbITFGXb9D38DxQU.png)
Figure 6.52How much work is needed to empty a tank

partially filled with water?

Using this coordinate system, the water extends from $x=2$ to $x=10$ .Therefore, we partition the interval [2, 10] and look at the work required to lift each individual “layer” of water. So, for i =0 $i=0$ $i= 0$, 1, 2, …, $n$, 指$n$ let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval [2, 10], and for $i=1$ i = 1 $i=1,2,...,n$ n $n$ ,，choose an arbitrary point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ .Figure 6.53 shows a representative layer.

![](./images/fHCQBZ8XmcaRcZOuZMMIgdBXEzog4AnS6.png)
Figure 6.53A representative layer of water

In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to overcome gravity, so it is equal to the weight of the water.Given that the weight-density of wateris 9800 N/ $m^{3}$ ,or 62.4 lb/ft$^3$ calculating the volume of each laver gives us the weight.In this case,we have

V=π(4)²Δx=16πΔx.

Then, the force needed to lift each layer is

F=9800⋅16πΔx=156,800πΔx.

Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank. We look at a noncylindrical tank in the next example

We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate systems, we can use $x_i^*$ as

an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to lift the ith layer of water $W_{i}$ is approximately

Wᵢ≈156,800πxᵢ*Δx.

Adding the work for each layer, we see the approximate work to empty the tank is given by

W = Σ_(i=1)^n Wᵢ ≈ Σ_(i=1)^n 156800πxᵢ* Δx

This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit as n→∞ ，we get

W = lim_(n→∞) Σ_(i=1)^n 156800πxᵢ* Δx = 156800π∫₂¹⁰ x dx = 156800π[x²/2]|₂¹⁰ = 7526400π ≈ 23644883

The work required to empty the tank is approximately 23,650,000 J.

For pumping problems, the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container. The following problemsolving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.

# Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Pumping Problems

1. Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference. 2. Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water. 3.Multiply the volume by the weight-density of water to get the force. 4.Calculate the distance the layer of water must be lifted. 5. Multiply the force and distance to get an estimate of the work needed to lift the layer of water. 6.Sum the work required to lift all the layers. This expression is an estimate of the work required to pump out the desired amount of water, and it is in the form of a Riemann sum. 7.Take the limit as n→∞ and evaluate the resulting integral to get the exact work required to pump out the desired amount of water.

We now apply this problem-solving strategy in an example with a noncylindrical tank.

# Example 6.26

## A Pumping Problem with a Noncylindrical Tank

Assume a tank in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 12 ft and base radius 4 ft. The tank is full to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until the height of the water remaining in the tank is 4 ft. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

## Solution

The tank is depicted in Figure 6.54. As we did in the example with the cylindrical tank, we orient the $x$ -axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive (step 1).

![](./images/fzYZxBrFyF314z3Fkg6h7nHEkIX99DIny.png)
Figure 6.54 A water tank in the shape of an inverted cone.

The tank starts out full and ends with 4 ft of water left,so,based on our chosen frame of reference,we need to partition the interval [O, 8]. Then, for $i=0$ , 1, 2.... $n$ ，let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval [0,8], and for $i=1$ i = 1 $i= 1$, 2, …, $n$, choose an arbitrary point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ .We can approximate the volume of a layer by using a disk, then use similar triangles to find the radius of the disk (see the following figure)

![](./images/f1MHpZKUvagzx59GdVHvwp0Vrs71BclB3.png)
Figure 6.55 Using similar triangles to express the radius of a disk of water

From properties of similar triangles, we have

rᵢ/(12-xᵢ*)=4/12=1/3, 3rᵢ=12-xᵢ*, rᵢ=(12-xᵢ*)/3=4-xᵢ*/3

Then the volume of the disk is

Vᵢ = π(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 2)

The weight-density of water is 62.4 Ib/ft$^3$ , so the force needed to lift each layer is approximately

Fᵢ ≈ 62.4π(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 3)

Based on the diagram, the distance the water must be lifted is approximately $x_l^{*}$ feet (step 4), so the approximat work needed to lift the layer is

Wᵢ ≈ 62.4πxᵢ*(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 5).

Summing the work required to lift all the layers, we get an approximate value of the total work

W = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿWᵢ ≈ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ62.4πxᵢ*(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx (step 6)

Taking the limit as n→∞ ，we obtain

W = lim<sub>n→∞</sub> Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ 62.4πxᵢ*(4 - xᵢ*/3)²Δx = ∫₀⁸ 62.4πx(4 - x/3)²dx = 62.4π∫₀⁸ x(16 - 8x/3 + x²/9)dx = 62.4π∫₀⁸ (16x - 8x²/3 + x³/9)dx = 62.4π[8x² - 8x³/9 + x⁴/36]|₀⁸ = 10,649.6π ≈ 33,456.7

It takes approximately 33,450 ft-lb of work to empty the tank to the desired level

M

6.26 A tank is in the shape of an inverted cone.with height 10 ft and base radius 6 ft. The tank is filled to depth of 8 ft to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until 3 ft of water remain in the tank. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

# Hydrostatic Force and Pressure

In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the English system, force is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.

Let's begin with the simple case of a plate of area $A$ submerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 6.56). Then, the force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by F=ρAs ，where ρ is the weight density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a submerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p=F/A=ρs

![](./images/fkcUu9zsEAgHIewczeQRVOyXIKX1URnpz.png)
Figure 6.56A plate submerged horizontally in water

By Pascal’s principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is submerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal’s principle to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F=ρAs directly,

because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we form a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.

Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the $X$ axis is oriented vertically, with the downward direction being positive, and point $x=0$ corresponding to a logicalreference point. Let $s(x)$ denote the depth at point $X$ .Note we often let $x=0$ correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply given by $s(x)=x$ .However, in some cases we may want to select a different reference point for $X=0$ ，so we proceed with the development in the more general case. Last, let $w(x)$ denote the width of the plate at the point λ

Assume the top edge of the plate is at point $x=u$ and the bottom edge of the plate is at point $x=b$ .Then, for $i=0$ , 1, 2...., n,let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of the interval $[a,b]$, and for $i=1$ , 2..... $Il$ ，choose an arbitrary point $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ .The partition divides the plate into several thin, rectangular strips (see the following figure).

![](./images/fW9dK7G4ghLwPauWtUGTQsgT4xXvAcPkY.png)
Figure 6.57A thin plate submerged vertically in water.

Let's now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it is at a constant depth. $s(x_i^*)$ .We then have

Fᵢ=ρAs=ρ[w(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*)

Adding the forces,we get an estimate for the force on the plate

F ≈ Σ_(i=1)^n Fᵢ = Σ_(i=1)^n ρ[w(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*).

This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit gives us the exact force. We obtain

F=lim_(n→∞)Σᵢ₌₁ⁿρ[w(xᵢ*)Δx]s(xᵢ*)=∫ₐᵇρw(x)s(x)dx

Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-solving strategy.

## Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Hydrostatic Force

1. Sketch a picture and select an appropriate frame of reference. (Note that if we select a frame of reference other than the one used earlier, we may have to adjust Equation 6.13 accordingly.) 2.Determine the depth and width functions, $s(x)$ and $w(x)$ 3.Determine the weight-density of whatever liquid with which you are working. The weight-density of water is $62.41b/ft^{3}$ or $9800N/m^{3}$ 4.Use the equation to calculate the total force

# Example 6.27

## Finding Hydrostatic Force

A water trough 15 ft long has ends shaped like inverted isosceles triangles, with base 8 ft and height 3 ft. Find the force on one end of the trough if the trough is full of water.

#  Solution

Figure 6.58 shows the trough and a more detailed view of one end

![](./images/fLZerDAtQqxVLfEqufEt0Bk1C7KALD4yZ.png)
Figure 6.58 (a) A water trough with a triangular cross-section. (b)

Dimensions of one end of the water trough.

Select a frame of reference with the $X$ -axis oriented vertically and the downward direction being positive. Select the top of the trough as the point corresponding to $x=0$ (step 1). The depth function, then, is $s(x)=x$ Using similar triangles, we see that $w(x)=8-(8/3)x$ (step 2). Now, the weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft$^3$ (step 3), so applying Equation 6.13, we obtain

F =∫ₐᵇρw(x)s(x)dx =∫₀³62.4(8 - (8/3)x)x dx = 62.4∫₀³(8x - (8/3)x²)dx = 62.4[4x² - (8/9)x³]|₀³ = 748.8

The water exerts a force of 748.8 Ib on the end of the trough (step 4).

6.27 A water trough $12m$ long has ends shaped like inverted isosceles triangles, with base 6 m and height 4 m.Find the force on one end of the trough if the trough is full of water

# Example 6.28

## Chapter Opener: Finding Hydrostatic Force

We now return our attention to the Hoover Dam, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The actual dam is arched, rather than flat, but we are going to make some simplifying assumptions to help us with the calculations. Assume the face of the Hoover Dam is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid with lower base 750 ft, upper base 1250 ft, and height 750 ft (see the following figure).

![](./images/fuwGGdafT4V7pxg0PiPK1dzctupZUZMZm.png)

When the reservoir is full, Lake Mead’s maximum depth is about 530 ft, and the surface of the lake is about 10 ft below the top of the dam (see the following figure).

![](./images/fISmIbp7tRU8xVHge6PeU9EHDP2aRzWrr.png)

assumed dimensions.

a.Find the force on the face of the dam when the reservoir is full

b.The southwest United States has been experiencing a drought, and the surface of Lake Mead is about 125 ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full.What is the force on the face of the dam under these circumstances?

### Solution

a.We begin by establishing a frame of reference. As usual, we choose to orient the $X$ -axis vertically, with the downward direction being positive.This time,however, we are going to let $x=0$ represent the top of the dam, rather than the surface of the water. When the reservoir is full, the surface of the water is 10 ft below the top of the dam, so $s(x)=x-10$ (see the following figure)

![](./images/feFsGhCFzMs9PsbvyYWL5U0GX7wxdGwIZ.png)
Figure 6.60We first choose a frame of reference

To find the width function, we again turn to similar triangles as shown in the figure below
![](./images/fmdvQg9VEdML2i7yKICzKpkU1VIFp25Y2.png)

for the width of the dam. (a) Assumed dimensions of the dam (b) highlighting the similar triangles.

From the figure, we see that $w(x)=750+2r$ .Using properties of similar triangles, we get $r=250-(1/3)x$ Thus,

w(x)=1250-(2/3)x (step 2)

Using a weight-density of 62.4 lb/ft$^3$ (step 3) and applying Equation 6.13,we get

F = ∫ₐᵇ ρw(x)s(x)dx = ∫₁₀⁵⁴⁰ 62.4(1250 - (2/3)x)(x-10)dx = 62.4∫₁₀⁵⁴⁰ -(2/3)[x² - 1885x + 18750]dx = -(62.4)(2/3)[x³/3 - (1885x²)/2 + 18750x]|₁₀⁵⁴⁰ ≈ 8,832,245,000 lb = 4,416,122.5 t

Note the change from pounds to tons $(200001b=1$ ton) (step 4)

b.Notice that the drought changes our depth function, $s(x)$ ,and our limits of integration. We have $s(x)=x-135$ .The lower limit of integration is 135. The upper limit remains 540. Evaluating the integral, we get

![](./images/fK045ztzaIBpg7EXqWDoqDsUe1R6mQAtk.png)

6.28When the reservoir is at its average level, the surface of the water is about 50 ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full. What is the force on the face of the dam under these circumstances?

# 6.6 | Moments and Centers of Mass

# Learning Objectives

6.6.1Find the center of mass of objects distributed along a line.

6.6.2Locate the center of mass of a thin plate. 6.6.3 Use symmetry to help locate the centroid of a thin plate 6.6.4 Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume.

In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and moments. The basic idea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the ends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate (without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers spin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.) Mathematically, that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate.

In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by applying the theorem of Pappus.

## Center of Mass and Moments

Let's begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_2$ at distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.62(b)

![](./images/fXDVVQu0UXDhYVrdVHaVxxqVgT387g0kR.png)
Figure 6.62 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are

placed on the rod

The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if $m_{1}d_{1}=m_{2}d_{2}$

In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However, we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$ ,located on a number line at points λ₁ and A₂

respectively (Figure 6.63). The center of mass, x̄ ，is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system balance.

![](./images/fhUrGEWaHFaiqA3FKn8FMkRDALdmGtR4g.png)

Figure 6.63 The center of mass x̄ is the balance point o the system.

Thus, we have

m₁|x₁ - x̄| = m₂|x₂ - x̄|; m₁(x̄ - x₁) = m₂(x₂ - x̄); m₁x̄ - m₁x₁ = m₂x₂ - m₂x̄; x̄(m₁ + m₂) = m₁x₁ + m₂x₂; x̄ = (m₁x₁ + m₂x₂)/(m₁ + m₂)

The expression in the numerator, $m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}$ ,is called the first moment of the system with respect to the origin. If the context is clear, we often drop the word first and just refer to this expression as the moment of the system. The expression in the denominator, $m_{1}+m_{2}$ ,is the total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment.

This idea is not limited just to two point masses. In general, if Tr masses, $m_{1}$ m $m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n}$ mn $m_n$ are placed on a number line at points $x_1$ X1 $x_1$, $x_2, . . .$, $x_n$ ,，respectively, then the center of mass of the system is given by

### Theorem 6.9: Center of Mass of Objects on a Line

Let m $m_{1}$ m₁,m₂,…,mₙ be point masses placed on a number line at points $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$ respectively, and le m=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢ deniethtal aso eseahetl onetat ese it et erg nsgeee by

M = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ mᵢxᵢ

and the center of mass of the system is given by

x̄=M/m

We apply this theorem in the following example.

### Example 6.29

Finding the Center of Mass of Objects along a Line

Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:

m₁ = 30 kg, placed at x₁ = -2 m  m₂ = 5 kg, placed at x₂ = 3 m  m₃ = 10 kg, placed at x₃ = 6 m  m₄ = 15 kg, placed at x₄ = -3 m

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.

### Solution

First,we need to calculate the moment of the system:

M = Σᵢ₌₁⁴ mᵢxᵢ = -60 + 15 + 60 - 45 = -30

Now, to find the center of mass, we need the total mass of the system
m = Σᵢ₌₁⁴mᵢ = 30 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 60 kg

Then we have

x̄ = M/m = -30/60 = -1/2

The center of mass is located $1/2m$ to the left of the origin

6.29Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows
m₁=12 kg, placed at x₁=-4 m  m₂=12 kg, placed at x₂=4 m  m₃=30 kg, placed at x₃=2 m  m₄=6 kg, placed at x₄=-6 m.

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.

We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane. Let $m_1$ be a point mass located at point $(x_1,y_1)$ in the plane. Then the moment $M_{x}$ of the mass with respect to the $x$ -axis is given by $M_{x}=m_{1}y_{1}$ .Similarly, the moment $M_{y}$ with respect to the y-axis is given by $M_{y}=m_{1}x_{1}$ . Notice that the $x$ -coordinate of the point is used to calculate the moment with respect to the $y$ -axis, and vice versa. The reason is that the $x$ -coordinate gives the distance from the point mass to the $y$ axis, and the y-coordinate gives the distance to the $X$ -axis (see the following figure).

![](./images/fWRgchZyTkl24cInvWb9nkVK4MGwT91lS.png)
Figure 6.64 Point mass $m_1$ is located at point $(x_1,y_1)$ i

the plane.

If we have several point masses in the xy-plane, we can use the moments with respect to the $x-$ and y-axes to calculate the

χ- and y-coordinates of the center of mass of the system.

## Theorem 6.10: Center of Mass of Objects in a Plane

Let $m1$ $m_2$ ... $m_n$ be point masses located in the xy-plane at points $(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})$ , respectively, and let m => m; denote the totl maso the system. Then the moments $M_{x}$ and $My$ of the system with rspec to the $x-$ and y-axes, respectively, are given by

Mₓ = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢyᵢ and Mᵧ = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢxᵢ

 Also, the coordinates of the center of mass (x̄,ȳ) of the system are

x̄=M<sub>y</sub>/m and ȳ=M<sub>x</sub>/m.

The next example demonstrates how to apply this theorem.

## Example 6.30

## Finding the Center of Mass of ObjectsinaPlane

Suppose three point masses are placed in the xy-plane as follows (assume coordinates are given in meters):

$m_{1}= 2$ kg placed at (1, 3) m = 6 kg, placed at (1, 1), m = 4 kg, placed at (2, 2).

Find the center of mass of the system.

### Solution

First we calculate the total mass of the system

m=∑ᵢ₌₁³mᵢ=2+6+4=12 kg

Next we find the moments with respect to the χ- and y-axes:

14) My = Σᵢ₌₁³ mᵢxᵢ = -2 + 6 + 8 = 12, Mx = Σᵢ₌₁³ mᵢyᵢ = 6 + 6 - 8 = 4.

Then we have

x̄ = My/m = 12/12 = 1 and ȳ = Mx/m = 4/12 = 1/3.

The center of mass of the system is (1, 1/3), in meters.

6.30 Suppose three point masses are placed on a number line as follows (assume coordinates are given in 国meters):

m₁ = 5 kg, placed at (-2, -3); m₂ = 3 kg, placed at (2, 3); m₃ = 2 kg, placed at (-3, -2)

Find thecenter of massof the svstem

## Center of Mass of Thin Plates

So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having the mass of a system concentrated at discrete points,we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is twodimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.

Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only on the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses, we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the χ- and y-axes.

We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the lamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle. Based on this understanding. it is clear that the center of mass of a rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect, which is a result of the symmetry principle, and it is stated here without proof.

## Theorem 6.11: The Symmetry Principle

If a region $R$ is symmetric about a line I, then the centroid of. $R$ lies on I.

Let's turn to more general laminas. Suppose we have a lamina bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ belowby the $x$ axis.and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ respectively, as shown in the following figure

![](./images/fGSAW5uF0R41n5G0DlYdbYXh25KupsyPu.png)

Figure 6.65A region in the plane representing a lamina

As with systems of point masses, to find the center of mass of the lamina, we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the χ- and $y$ -axes. As we have done many times before, we approximate these quantities by partitioning the interval $[ a$, $b]$ and constructing rectangles

For $i=0$ , 1, 2..... $m$ ，let P={xᵢ} be a regular partition of $[a,b]$ .Recall that we can choose any point within the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ as our $x_i^*$ . In this case, we want $x_i^{*}$ to bethe $x$ -Coordinate of the centroid of our rectangles. Thus, for $i=1$ , 2... 71 ,we select $x_{i}^{* }$ ∈ [xᵢ₋₁, $x_{i}]$ such that $x_i^{*}$ is the midpoint of the interval. That is, $x_{i}^{* }$ $= ( x_{i- 1}+ x_{i}) / 2$ Now, for $i=1$ ,2...., n,construct a rectangle of height f（x）on $[ x_{i- 1}$, $x_i]$ .The center of mass of this rectangle is

(xᵢ*, f(xᵢ*)/2) as shown in the fllowing figure.

![](./images/fPAQzClzvk1a6Mm53V8gnCvZ9IFL3o1a0.png)
Figure 6.66 A representative rectangle of the lamina.

Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let ρ represent the density of the lamina (note that ρ is a constant) In this case, ρ is expressed in terms of mass per unit area. Thus, to find the total mass of the rectangle, we multiply the area of the rectangle by ρ .Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by ρf(xᵢ*)Δx

To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get

m≈Σᵢ₌₁ⁿρf(xᵢ*)Δx

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ gives the exact mass of the lamina:

m=lim_(n→∞)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿρf(xᵢ*)Δx=ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the $X$ -axis. Returning to the representative rectangle, recall its center of mass is (xᵢ*, f(xᵢ*)/2) Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of mass does not change the moment. Thus, the moment of the rectangle with respect to the $X$ -axis is given by the mass of the rectangle, ρf(xᵢ*)Δx ,multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the λ -axis: f(xᵢ^#)/2 .Therefore, the moment with respect to the $X$ -axis of the rectangle is ρ([f(xᵢ* ]²/2)Δx . Adding the moments of the rectangles and taking the limit of the resulting Riemann sum,we see that the moment of the lamina with respect to the $X$ -axis is

Mx=limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿρ[f(xᵢ*)]²/2Δx=ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²/2dx

We derive the moment with respect to the .y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center of mass of the rectangle to the y-axis is xᵢ# . Then the moment of the lamina with respect to the y-axis is given by

Mᵧ=limₙ→∞∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿρxᵢ*f(xᵢ*)Δx=ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x)dx

Wefindthe coordinates of the center of mass bydividing the moments by the totalmass togive x̄ $= M_{y}/ m$ and ȳ = Mₓ/m . If we look closely at the expressions for $M_{x},M_{y}$, and $m$ ,we notice that the constant ρ cancels out when x̄ and ȳ are calculated

We summarize these findings in the following theorem

### Theorem 6.12:Center of Mass of a Thin Plate in the xy-Plane

Let R denote aregionbounded aboveby the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ ，below by the $x$ axis, and on the left

and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ ,respectively. Let $P$ denote the density of the associated lamina. Then we can make the following statements:

i.The mass of the lamina is

m=ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx

ii.The moments $M_{x}$ and Mof the lamina with respect to the $X$ - and y-axes, respectively, are

Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²/2 dx and Mᵧ = ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x) dx

ii. The coordinates of the center of mass 
(x̄ , ȳ ) are


x̄=Mᵧ/m and ȳ=Mₓ/m

In the next example,we use this theorem to find the center of mass of a lamina

## Example 6.31

# Finding the Center of Mass of a Lamina

Let $R$ be the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x) = √x and below by the $x$ -axis over the interval [0, 4]. Find the centroid of the region

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure

![](./images/fv1UktwQUgFkwgLT6y5I2K5XiKRYpdyFI.png)
Figure 6.67 Finding the center of mass of a lamina

Since we are only asked for the centroid of the region, rather than the mass or moments of the associated lamina, we know the density constant ρ cancels out of the calculations eventually. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, let's assume ρ=1

First, we need to calculate the total mass:

n=ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx=∫₀⁴√x dx = (2/3)x³/²|₀⁴=(2/3)[8-0]=16/3

Next, we compute the moments:

Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²dx = ∫₀⁴x/2dx = 1/4x²|₀⁴ = 4

and

My = ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x)dx = ∫₀⁴x√xdx = ∫₀⁴x^(3/2)dx = (2/5)x^(5/2)|₀⁴ = (2/5)[32-0] = 64/5

Thus, we have


x̄ = My/m = (64/5)/(16/3) = 12/5 and ȳ = Mx/y = 4/(16/3) = 3/4. 

The centroid of the region is (12/5, 3/4),

6.31 Let $R$ be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ and below by the X -axis over the interval[O,2]. Find the centroid of the region

We can adapt this approach to find centroids of more complex regions as well. Suppose our region is bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ ,，as before, but now, instead of having the lower bound for the region be the $X$ -axis, suppose the region is bounded below by the graph of a second continuous function, $g(x)$ ，as shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fPiOapbmbvNiI1ucnmxgHnwkFzP65R4MK.png)
Figure 6.68 A region between two functions.

Again, we partition the interval $[a,b]$ and construct rectangles. A representative rectangle is shown in the following figure

![](./images/fvM171Gid05R8fBdiCiGg9ZhMEVZAdzh8.png)
 Figure 6.69 A representative rectangle of the region between

two functions.

Note that the centroid of this rectangle is (xᵢ*, (f(xᵢ*) + g(xᵢ*))/2) We won't go through allthe details of the Riemann sum development, but let's look at some of the key steps. In the development of the formulas for the mass of the lamina and the moment with respect to the $y$ -axis, the height of each rectangle is given by $f( x_{i}^{* }$ $) - g( x_{i}^{* }$ ), which leads to the expression $f(x)-g(x)$ in the integrands.

In the development of the formula for the moment with respect to the $X$ -axis, the moment of each rectangle is found by multiplying the area of the rectangle, ρ[f(xᵢ* $) - g( x_{i}^{* }$ ]Δx ，by the distance of the centroid from the $x$ -axis, $( f( x_{i}^{* }$ $) + g( x_{i}^{* }$ ))/2 which gives ρ(1/2)[f(xᵢ*) ]² - [g(xᵢ*) )²} Summarizing these findings, we arrive at the following theorem,

# Theorem 6.13: Center of Mass of a Lamina Bounded by Two Functions

Let $R$ denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ ，below by the graph of the continuous function $g(x)$ ,and on the left and right by the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ respectively. Let ρ denote the density of the associated lamina. Then we can make the following statements:

i.The mass of the lamina is

m=ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx

i.The moments $M_{x}$ and M、 of the lamina with respect to the $X$ - and y-axes,respectively, are

Mₓ=ρ∫ₐᵇ(1/2)[f(x)²-g(x)²]dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx

ii. The coordinates of the center of mass (x̄,ȳ) are


x̄=Mᵧ/m and ȳ=Mₓ/m

We illustrate this theorem in the following example

## Example 6.32

# Finding the Centroid of a Region Bounded by Two Functions

Let $R$ be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=1-x^{2}$ and below by the graph of the function $g(x)=x-1$ .Find the centroid of the region.

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure

![](./images/fnOk2IFyqggSsfAqp1QBo5PvZpzqslowH.png)
Fiqure 6.70Finding the centroid of a region between two

curves.

The graphs of the functions intersect at (-2,-3) and (1, 0), so we integrate from -2 to 1. Once again, for the sake of convenience, assume ρ=1

First, we need to calculate the total mass

n = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx = ∫₋₂¹[1-x²-(x-1)]dx = ∫₋₂¹(2-x²-x)dx = [2x-(1/3)x³-(1/2)x²]|₋₂¹ = [2-(1/3)-(1/2)]-[-4+(8/3)-2] = 9/2

Next, we compute the moments

Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ(1/2)[(f(x))² - (g(x))²]dx = (1/2)∫₋₂¹((1-x²)² - (x-1)²)dx = (1/2)∫₋₂¹(x⁴ - 3x² + 2x)dx = (1/2)[x⁵/5 - x³ + x²]|₋₂¹ = -27/10

and

My = ρ∫ₐᵇ x[f(x)-g(x)]dx = ∫₋₂¹ x[(1-x²)-(x-1)]dx = ∫₋₂¹ x[2-x²-x]dx = ∫₋₂¹(2x-x⁴-x²)dx = [x² - x⁵/5 - x³/3]|₋₂¹ = -9/4.

Therefore, we have

x̄=Mᵧ/m=-9/4(2/9)=-1/2 and ȳ=Mₓ/m=-27/10(2/9)=-3/5

The centroid of the region is ((1/2),(3/5))

6.32 Let $R$ be theregion bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=6-x^{2}$ and below by the grapl of the function $g(x)=3-2x$ Find the centroid of the region.

# The Symmetry Principle

We stated the symmetry principle earlier, when we were looking at the centroid of a rectangle. The symmetry principle can be a great help when finding centroids of regions that are symmetric. Consider the following example

### Example 6.33

### Finding the Centroid of a Symmetric Region

Let $R$ be the region bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=4-x^{2}$ and below by the $x$ -axis. Find the centroid of the region.

### Solution

The region is depicted in the following figure.

![](./images/fr7XbVskMzn7sZmzlrs6OC9fxVVhgT6Pl.png)

Figure 6.71 We can use the symmetry principle to help find the centroid of a symmetric region

The region is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the $x$ -Coordinate of the centroid is zero. We neec only calculate ȳ . Once again, for the sake of convenience, assume ρ=1

First, we calculate the total mass:

m = ρ∫ₐᵇf(x)dx = ∫₋₂² (4-x²)dx = [4x - x³/3]|₋₂² = 32/3

Next, we calculate the moments. We only need $M_{x}$

Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)]²dx = (1/2)∫₋₂² (4-x²)²dx = (1/2)∫₋₂² (16-8x²+x⁴)dx = (1/2)[x⁵/5 - 8x³/3 + 16x]|₋₂² = 256/15

Then we have

ȳ = Mₓ/m = 256/15 * 3/32 = 8/5.

The centroid of the region is (0, 8/5)

M

6.33Let $R$ be theregion bounded above by the graph of the function $f(x)=1-x^{2}$ and below by $x$ -axis Find the centroid of the region.

# Student PROJECI

## The Grand Canyon Skywalk

The Grand Canyon Skywalk opened to the public on March 28, 2007. This engineering marvel is a horseshoe-shaped observation platform suspended 4000 ft above the Colorado River on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystal clear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).

![](./images/ff6fkBSteabRfYUPz9RXG5WOvrVmAwQYo.png)
Figure 6.72 The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta, Wikimedia

Commons)

The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with no visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are engineerec to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support posts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake within $50mi$ , and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 Ib.

One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate the center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the observation platform.

The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors’ center, 48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.

To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the xy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each subregion

separately. The first region, denoted $R_1$ , consists of the curved part of the U. We model $R_1$ as a semicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure)

![](./images/f4UNOZ5n1arGBwgcdy6tDkypK09G7B4el.png)
Figure 6.73We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions.

The legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between $R_1$ and the canyon wall, comprise the second sub-region, $R_2$ Last, the ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise the third sub-region, $R_{3}$ .Assume the density of the lamina is constant and assume the total weight of the platform is 1,200,000 lb (not including the weight of the visitor center; we will consider that later). Use $g=32$ ft/sec2

1. Compute the area of each of the three sub-regions. Note that the areas of regions $R_2$ and $R_{3}$ should include the areas of the legs only, not the open space between them. Round answers to the nearest square foot. 2.Determine the mass associated with each of the three sub-regions 3.Calculate the center of mass of each of the three sub-regions. 4. Now, treat each of the three sub-regions as a point mass located at the center of mass of the corresponding sub-region. Using this representation, calculate the center of mass of the entire platform. 5. Assume the visitor center weighs 2,200,000 Ib, with a center of mass corresponding to the center of mass of $R_{3}$ . Treating the visitor center as a point mass, recalculate the center of mass of the system. How does the center of mass change? 6.Although the Skywalk was built to limit the number of people on the observation platform to 120, the platform is capable of supporting up to 800 people weighing 200 Ib each. If all 800 people were allowed on the platform and all of them went to the farthest end of the platform, how would the center of gravity of the system be affected? (Include the visitor center in the calculations and represent the people by a point mass located at the farthest edge of the platform,70 ft from the canyon wall.)

# Theorem of Pappus

This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to find the volume of particular

kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the theorem for volume.)

### Theorem 6.14: Theorem of Pappus for Volume

Let $R$ be a region in the plane and let I be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving $R$ around $I$ isequal to the areaof $R$ multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid of $R$

### Proof

We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function $f(x)$ and below by the graph of a function $g(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$, b $b]$, and for which the axis of revolution is the y-axis. In this case,the area of the region is A=∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx id only on the $X$ coordinate of the centroid, x̄ which is

x̄=Mᵧ/m

where

m=ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x)-g(x)]dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx

Then,

d = 2π(ρ∫ₐᵇx[f(x) - g(x)]dx)/(ρ∫ₐᵇ[f(x) - g(x)]dx)

and thus

dA = 2π∫ₐᵇ x[f(x)-g(x)]dx

However,using the method of cylindrical shells,we have

V=2π∫ₐᵇx[f(x)-g(x)]dx

So,

V = d⋅A

and the proof is complete.

The region $R$ is a circle of radius 2, so the area of $R$ is A = 4π units². By the symmetry principle, the centroid of $R$ is the center of the circle. The centroid travels around the y-axis in a circular path of radius 4, so the centroid travels d=8π units. Then, the volume of the torus is A⋅d=32π² units3

# 6.7 | Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms

# Learning Objectives

6.7.1 Write the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral 6.7.2 Recognize the derivative of the natural logarithm. 6.7.3 Integrate functions involving the natural logarithmic function. 6.7.4 Define the number $e$ through an integral. 6.7.5Recognize the derivative and integral of the exponential function 6.7.6 Prove properties of logarithms and exponential functions using integrals. 6.7.7 Express general logarithmic and exponential functions in terms of natural logarithms and exponentials.

We already examined exponential functions and logarithms in earlier chapters. However, we glossed over some key details in the previous discussions. For example, we did not study how to treat exponential functions with exponents that are irrational. The definition of the number $e$ is another area where the previous development was somewhat incomplete. We now have the tools to deal with these concepts in a more mathematically rigorous way, and we do so in this section.

For purposes of this section, assume we have not yet defined the natural logarithm, the number e, or any of the integration and differentiation formulas associated with these functions. By the end of the section, we will have studied these concepts in a mathematically rigorous way (and we will see they are consistent with the concepts we learned earlier)

We begin the section by defining the natural logarithm in terms of an integral. This definition forms the foundation for the section. From this definition, we derive differentiation formulas, define the number $e$ ，and expand these concepts to logarithms and exponential functions of any base.

# The Natural Logarithm as an Integral

Recall the power rule for integrals:

∫xⁿdx=xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1)+C, n≠-1

Clearly, this does not work when $n=-1$ ，as it would force us to divide by zero.So, what do we do with /dx ? Recall from the Ffundametl Theorem of Calculu that ∫₁ˣ 1/t dt is an aniderivative of $1/x$ . Therefore we an make th folowing definition.

### Definition

For $x>0$ define the natural logarithm function by

ln x = ∫₁ˣ 1/t dt

For $x>1$ .thisis ust the aede the ue $y=1/t$ from 1 to $x.$ For $x<1$ we have ∫₁ˣ1/t dt = -∫ₓ¹1/t dt .soin this case it is the negative of the area under the curve from $x$ to 1 (see the following figure)

![](./images/fEXwL4NBHC6yefgEGaldZ8pg4yO0uQ35b.png)
Figure 6.75 (a)When $x>1$ , the natural logarithm is the area under the

curve $y=1/t$ from 1 to $x$ (b) When $x<1$ ,the natural logarithm is the negative of the area under the curve from $x$ to 1.

Notice that ln1=0 . Furthermore, the function $y=1/t>0$ for $x>0$ . Therefore, by the properties of integrals,it is clear that ln x is increasing for $x>0$

# Properties of the Natural Logarithm

Because of the way we defined the natural logarithm, the following differentiation formula falls out immediately as a result of to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

# Theorem 6.15: Derivative of the Natural Logarithm

For $x>0$ , the derivative of the natural logarithm is given by

d/dx ln x = 1/x

Theorem 6.16: Corollary to the Derivative of the Natural Logarithm

The function ln x is differentiable; therefore, it is continuous.

A graph of ln x is shown in Figure 6.76. Notice that it is continuous throughout its domain of (0, ∞

![](./images/fE2yNUlWCYDknpkq9ewbxyFwkaGBGuoPt.png)
Figure 6.76The graph of f(x) = ln x shows that it is a

continuous function.

## Example 6.35

### Calculating Derivatives of Natural Logarithms

Calculate the following derivatives:

a. d/dx(ln(5x³ - 2)) b. d/dx(ln(3x))²

## Solution

We need to apply the chain rule in both cases.

a d/dx ln(5x³ - 2) = 15x²/(5x³ - 2) b. d/dx(ln(3x))² = (2(ln(3x))*3)/(3x) = (2ln(3x))/x 

6.35Calculate the following derivatives

M

a. d/dx ln(2x²+x)  b. d/dx (ln(x³))²

Note that if we use the absolute yalue function and create a new function In lx.we can extend the domain of the natural logarithm to include $x<0$ .Then (d/dx)ln|x|=1/x This gives rise to the familiar integration formula

### Theorem 6.17: Integral of (1lu) du

The natural logarithm is the antiderivative of the function $f(u)=1/u$

∫(1/u)du=ln|u|+C

### Example 6.36

Calculating Integrals Involving Natural Logarithms

Calculate he integral ∫x/(x² + 4) dx

### Solution

Using $ll$ -substitution, let $u=x^{2}+4$ .Then $du= 2x$ $dx$ and we have

∫x/(x²+4)dx=(1/2)∫(1/u)du=(1/2)ln|u|+C=(1/2)ln|x²+4|+C=(1/2)ln(x²+4)+C.

![](./images/fkgNc6Lbasu94yF38CS6vQ0vqxkx9rMRD.png)

6.36 alule th integral ∫x²/(x³+6)dx

Although we have called our function a “logarithm,” we have not actually proved that any of the properties of logarithms hold for this function. We do so here.

### Theorem 6.18: Properties of the Natural Logarithm

If $a$ $b>0$ and $r$ is a rational number, then

ln1=0
ii。ln(ab)=ln a+ln b m. ln(a/b)=lna-lnb iv. ln(aʳ) = rln a

### Proof

ln 1 = ∫₁¹ (1/t) dt = 0

ii. We have

ln(ab) = ∫₁^(ab) 1/t dt = ∫₁^a 1/t dt + ∫ₐ^(ab) 1/t dt.

Use $lt$ -substitution on the last integral in this expression.Let $u=t/a$ .Then $du=(1/a)dt$ .Furthermore, when t =a $t=a$ $t= a$, $u= 1$ u = 1 $u=1$ and when $t=ab$ ι = b .So we get

ln(ab)=∫₁^a(1/t)dt+∫ₐ^(ab)(1/t)dt=∫₁^a(1/t)dt+∫₁^b(1/u)du=ln a+ln b.

iv. Note that

d/dx ln(xʳ) = rxʳ⁻¹/xʳ = r/x.

Furthermore,

d/dx(rlnx) = r/x

Since the derivatives of these two functions are the same, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, they must differ by a constant. So we have

ln(xʳ)=rlnx+C

for some constant $C$ Taking $x=1$ ，we get

ln(1ʳ)=rln(1)+C; 0=r(0)+C; C=0

Thus ln(x')=rln x and the proof is complete. Note that we can extend this property to irational values of $r$ later in this section.

Part i. follows from parts ii. and iv. and the proof is left to you.

# Example 6.37

Using Properties of Logarithms

Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm

ln9-2ln3+ln(1/3)

### Solution

We have

ln9-2ln3+ln(1/3)=-ln3

6.37Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm:

![](./images/fTDb0zrBpBz683TwIefYGg99gGNLdakGH.png)

ln8-ln2-ln(1/4)

# Defining the Number e

Now that we have the natural logarithm defined, we can use that function to define the number e.

### Definition

The number $e$ is defined tobe thereal number such that

ln e = 1

To put it another way, the area under the curve $y=1/t$ between $t=1$ and $t=e$ is 1 (Figure 6.77).The proof that such a number exists and is unique is left to you. (Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove existence and the fact that ln x is increasing to prove uniqueness.)

![](./images/f3v5yeacwsZHcXEdGt5aUgR1huHVGtCZP.png)
Figure 6.77The area under the curve from 1 to $e$ is equa

to one.

The number $e$ can be shown to be irrational, although we won't do so here (see the Student Project in Taylor and Maclaurin Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53817/latest/) ). Its approximate value is given by

e 2.71828182846

# The Exponential Function

We now turn our attention to the function $e^{x}$ .Note that the natural logarithm is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function. For now, we denote this inverse function by exp x. Then

exp(ln x) = x for x > 0 and ln(exp x) = x for all x

The following figure shows the graphs of exp x and ln x

![](./images/fqUVOOcr9lGX0FL0Go3cDiPgSf7TvypU0.png)
Figure 6.78The graphs of ln x and exp x

We hypothesize that exp x=eˣ .For rational values of $x$ ，this is easy to show.If $x$ is rational, then we have ln(e^x)=xln e=x Thus, when $x$ is rational, eˣ = exp x. For irrational values of $x$ we simply define $e^{x}$ as the inverse function of ln x

## Definition

For any real number $x$ define $y=e^{X}$ to be the number for which

ln y=ln(eˣ)=x

Then wehave eˣ = exp(x) for all $X$ andthus

eˡⁿˣ=x for x>0 and ln(eˣ)=x

for all $JI$

## Properties of the Exponential Function.

Since the exponential function was defined in terms of an inverse function, and not in terms of a power of $e$ we must verify that the usual laws of exponents hold for the function $e^x$

### Theorem 6.19: Properties of the Exponential Function

If $p$ and $q$ are any real numbers and $r$ is a rational number, then

eᵖeᵠ=eᵖ⁺ᵠ
lil. e^p/e^q = e^(p-q) lil。$(e^{P})^{r}=e^{pr}$

### Proof

Note that if $p$ and $q$ are rational, the properties hold. However, if $p$ or $q$ are irrational, we must apply the inverse function definition of $e^{x}$ and verify the properties. Only the first property is verified here; the other two are left to you. We have

ln(e^p e^q) = ln(e^p) + ln(e^q) = p + q = ln(e^(p+q))

Since ln x is one-to-one, then

$$e^{p}e^{q}=e^{p+q}.$$

口

As with part iv. of the logarithm properties, we can extend property ii. to irrational values of $T$ ,and we do so by the end of the section.

We also want to verify the differentiation formula for the function $y=e^{X}$ .To do this, we need to use implicit differentiation. Let $y=e^{X}$ Then

lny = x, (d/dx)lny = (d/dx)x, (1/y)(dy/dx) = 1, (dy/dx) = y

Thus, we see

d/dx eˣ=eˣ

as desired. which leads immediately to the integration formula

∫eˣdx=eˣ+C

We apply these formulas in the following examples.

### Example 6.38

### Using Properties of Exponential Functions

Evaluate the following derivatives
d/dt(e³ᵗeᵗ²) , d/dx(e³ˣ²)

### Solution

We apply the chain rule as necessary


d/dt(e³ᵗeᵗ²)=d/dt(e³ᵗ⁺ᵗ²)=e³ᵗ⁺ᵗ²(3+2t)
b. d/dx e³ˣ² = e³ˣ²6x

6.38Evaluate the following derivatives:

a. d/dx(e^(x²)/e^(5x)); b. d/dt(e^(2t))³

## Example 6.39

Using Properties of Exponential Functions

Evaluate the fllowin integral: ∫2xe⁻ˣ²dx

###  Solution

Using $ll$ -substitution, let $u=-x^{2}$ . Then $du= - 2x$ $dx$ and we have

∫2xe⁻ˣ²dx=-∫eᵘdu=-eᵘ+C=-e⁻ˣ²+C

## General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

We close this section by looking at exponential functions and logarithms with bases other than ℓ . Exponential functions are functions of the form $f(x)=a^{x}$ Note that unless $a=e$ ，we still do not have a mathematically rigorous definition of these functions for irrational exponents. Let's rectify that here by defining the function $f(x)=a^{x}$ in terms of the exponential function $e^{X}$ .We then examine logarithms with bases other than $e$ as inverse functions of exponential functions.

### Definition

For any $a>0$ ,and for any real number $X$ define $y=a^{x}$ as follows

y=a<sup>x</sup>=e<sup>xln a</sup>

Now $a^{x}$ is defined rigorously for all values of $X$ This definition also allows us to generalize property iv.of logarithms and propertyi of exponentia functions to apply to both rational and irrational values of 7 .It is sraightforward to show that properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined in this way.

Let's now apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for $a^{x}$ We have

d/dx aˣ = d/dx e^(x ln a) = e^(x ln a) ln a = aˣ ln a.

 The corresponding integration formula follows immediately.

## Theorem 6.20: Derivatives and Integrals Involving General Exponential Functions

Let $a>0$ .Then,

d/dx aˣ = aˣ ln a

and


∫a<sup>x</sup>dx = (1/ln a)a<sup>x</sup> + C

If a≠1 ，then the function $a^{x}$ is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by logₐx Then

y = logₐx if and only if x = aʸ

Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y=logₐx Then, $x=a^y$ Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get

1, lnx=lnaʸ, lnx=ylna, y=lnx/lna, logx=lnx/lna

Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this formula to find a differentiation formula for a logarithm with base $d$ .Again, let y = logₐx Then,

dy/dx = d/dx(logₐx) = d/dx(ln x / ln a) = (1/ln a)d/dx(ln x) = 1/(ln a) * 1/x = 1/(x ln a)

## Theorem 6.21: Derivatives of General Logarithm Functions

Let $a>0$ . Then,

d/dx loga x = 1/(xln a).

### Example 6.40

Calculating Derivatives of General Exponential and Logarithm Functions

Evaluate the following derivatives:
a. d/dt(4^t⋅2^(2t)), b. d/dx(log₈(7x²+4))

### Solution

We need to apply the chain rule as necessary.

a。(d/dt)(4ᵗ⋅2ᵗ²)=(d/dt)(2²ᵗ⋅2ᵗ)=(d/dt)(2²ᵗ⁺ᵗ²)=2²ᵗ⁺ᵗ²ln(2)(2+2t) b. (d/dx)log₈(7x²+4)=[14x]/[(7x²+4)(ln8)]

 6.40 Evaluate the following derivtives:

a. 444 b. d/dx(log₃(√(x²+1))) 

### Example 6.41

Evalate thefllowing integral.. ∫3/2³ˣdx

### Solution

Use lι -substitution and let $u=-3x$ Then $du=-3dx$ and we have

∫3/2³ˣ dx = -1/(ln2)2⁻³ˣ + C

# 6.8 | Exponential Growth and Decay.

# Learning Objectives

6.8.1 Use the exponential growth model in applications,including population growth and compound interest. 6.8.2Explain the concept of doubling time. 6.8.3 Use the exponential decay model in applications, including radioactive decay and Newton's law of cooling 6.8.4 Explain the concept of half-life.

One of the most prevalent applications of exponential functions involves growth and decay models. Exponential growth and decay show up in a host of natural applications. From population growth and continuously compounded interest to radioactive decay and Newton's law of cooling, exponential functions are ubiquitous in nature. In this section, we examine exponential growth and decay in the context of some of these applications.

# Exponential Growth Model

Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form $y=y_{0}e^{kr}$ ，where $y_0$ represents the initial state of the system and $k$ is a positive constant, called the growth constant. Notice that in an exponential growth model, we have

$$y'=ky_{0}e^{kt}=ky.$$

That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of exponential growth. Equation 6.27 involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn more about differential equations in Introduction to Differential Equations (http:l/cnx.org/content/m53696/latest/)

## Rule: Exponential Growth Model

Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model.

$$y=y_{0}e^{kt},$$

where $y_0$ represents the initial state of the system and $k>0$ is a constant, called the growth constant.

Population growth is a common example of exponential growth. Consider a population of bacteria, for instance. It seems plausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria there are to reproduce, the faster the population grows. Figure 6.79 and Table 6.1 represent the growth of a population of bacteria with an initial population of 200 bacteria and a growth constant of 0.02. Notice that after only 2 hours (120 minutes),the population is 10 times its original size!

![](./images/fT6i4E0aYInlyE8Ic7DoW28fBFoa7r0Hy.png)
Figure 6.79An example of exponential growth for bacteria.


9|3
Table 6.1 Exponential Growth of a Bacterial Population

 Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At any given time, the real-world population contains a whole number of bacteria,although the model takes on noninteger values.When using exponential

growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are modeling

# Example 6.42

## Population Growth

Consider the population of bacteria described earlier.This population grows according to the function $f(t)=200e^{0.02r}$ where $t$ is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 5 hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000 bacteria?

# Solution

We have $f(t)=200e^{0.02t}$ . Then

f(300) = 200e^(0.02(300)) ≈ 80,686

There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours

To find when the population reaches 10o,000 bacteria, we solve the equation

100,000 = 200e<sup>0.02t</sup>, 500 = e<sup>0.02t</sup>, ln500 = 0.02t, t = ln500/0.02 ≈ 310.73

The population reaches 100.000 bacteria after 310.73 minutes.

![](./images/fP2gokOvfc3okCeQQbrwhsEvzg2N0AnM2.png)

6.42Consider a population of bacteria that grows according to the function $f(t)=500e^{0.05t}$ where $t$ is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 4 hours? When does the population reach 100 million bacteria?

Let's now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest.Interest that is not compounded is called simple interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually 1 year). So, if we put 1000$ in a savings account earning 2% simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have

$$1000(1+0.02)=51020.$$

Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank compounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year's interest to the account after 6 months. During the second half of the year, the account earns interest not only on the initial 1000$ but also on the interest earned during the first half of the year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have

$1000(1+0.02/2)²=1020.10.$$

Similarly, if the interest is compounded every 4 months, we have

$1000(1+0.02/3)³=1020.13,$$

and if the interest is compounded daily (365 times per year), we have S1020.20. If we extend this concept, so that the interest is compounded continuously, after $t$ years we have

limₙ→∞(1+0.02/n)ⁿᵗ

Now let's manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number $e$ can be expressed as a limit

e = lim_(m→∞)(1 + 1/m)ᵐ

Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form $(1+1/m)$ .Let $n=0.02m$ .Note that as n→∞, m→∞ as well. Then we get

1000lim_(n→∞)(1+0.02/n)^nt=1000lim_(m→∞)(1+1/m)^0.02mt=1000[lim_(m→∞)(1+1/m)^m]^0.02t

We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number $e$ .So, the balance in our bank account after $t$ years is given by $1000e^{0.02r}$ . Generalizing this concept, we seetha if a bank acoun with an initial alance of P$ earms interet at a rate of r% ，compounded continuously, then the balance of the account after $t$ years is

Balance=Pe^(rt)

# Example 6.43

## Compound Interest

A 25-year-old student is offered an opportunity to invest some money in a retirement account that pays 5% annual interest compounded continuously. How much does the student need to invest today to have 1$ millior when she retires at age 65 ? What if she could earm 6% annual interest compounded continuously instead?

### Solution

We have

1,000,000=Pe^(0.05(40))
P=135,335.28.

She must invest 135,335.28$ at 5% interest

If, instead, she is able to eam 6% ，then the equation becomes

$1,000,000 = Pe⁰·⁰⁶⁽⁴⁰⁾; P = 90,717.95.
In this case, she needs to invest only 90,717.95. This is roughly two-thirds the amount she needs to invest at 5% .The fact that the interest is compounded continuously greatly magnifies the effect of the 1% increase in interest rate.

6.43 Suppose instead of investing at age 25,the student waits until age 35.How much would she have to invest at 5% ? At 6% ？

If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant. In other words, it takes the same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from 100 to 200 bacteria as it does to grow from 10.000 to 20.00O bacteria. This time is called the doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity reaches twice its original size. So we have

2y₀=y₀eᵏᵗ; 2=eᵏᵗ; ln2=kt; t=ln2/k.

### Definition

If a quantity grows exponentially, the doubling time is the amount of time it takes the quantity to double. It is given by

Doubling time =ln2/k.

## Example 6.44

### Using the Doubling Time

Assume a population of fish grows exponentially. A pond is stocked initially with 500 fish. After 6 months, there are 10o0 fish in the pond. The owner will allow his friends and neighbors to fish on his pond after the fish population reaches 10,000. When will the owner's friends be allowed to fish?

### Solution

We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size. So,if $t$ represents time in months, by the doubling-time formula, we have 6=(ln2)/k Then, k=(ln2)/6 .Thus, the population is given by y=500e<sup>(ln2/6)</sup> To figure out when the population reaches 10.000 fish, we must solve the following equation:

10000=500e^((ln2/6)t)  20=e^((ln2/6)t)  ln20=(ln2)t  t=6(ln20)/ln2≈25.93

The owner's friends have to wait 25.93 months (a little more than 2 years) to fish in the pond.

 6.4 Suppose it takes 9 months for the fsh population in Example 6.4 toreach 100 fish. Under these circumstances,how long do the owner's friends have to wait?

# Exponential Decay Model

Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for example), or chemical compounds that break down over time.We say that suchsystems exhibit exponential decay,rather than exponential growth. The model is nearly the same, except there is a negative sign in the exponent. Thus, for some positive constant $k$ we have
$$y=y_{0}e^{-kt}.$$

As with exponential growth, there is a differential equation associated with exponential decay. We have

$$y'=-ky_{0}e^{-kt}=-ky.$$

## Rule: Exponential Decay Model

Systems that exhibit exponential decay behave according to the model

$$y=y_{0}e^{-kt},$$

where $y_0$ represents the initial state of the system and $k>0$ is a constant, called the decay constant.

The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.

![](./images/fU5GZ1avQSMySfYAhO4eZsWxENyEsvc6Z.png)
Figure 6.80An example of exponential decay.

Let's look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton’s law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings. In other words, if $I$ represents the temperature of the object and $T_{a}$ represents the ambient temperature in a room, then

T' = -k(T - Tₐ)

Note that this is not quite the right model for exponential decay. We want the derivative to be proportional to the function, and this expression has the additional $T_{a}$ term. Fortunately, we can make a change of variables that resolves this issue. Let

$y(t)=T(t)-T_{a}$ .Then y'(t)=T'(t)-0=T'(t) ,，and our equation becomes

y'=-ky.

From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus,

$$y=y_0e^{-kt},$$

 and we see that

T-Tₐ=(T₀-Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ; T=(T₀-Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ+Tₐ

where $T_{0}$ represents the initial temperature. Let's apply this formula in the following example.

## Example 6.45

## Newton's Law of Cooling

According to experienced baristas, the optimal temperature to serve coffee is between 155°F and 175°F. Suppose coffee is poured at a temperature of 200°F and after 2 minutes in a 70°F room it has cooled to

180°F When is the coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee too cold to serve? Round answers to the nearest half minute

### Solution

We have

T = (T₀ - Tₐ)e⁻ᵏᵗ + Tₐ, 180 = (200 - 70)e⁻ᵏ⁽²⁾ + 70, 110 = 130e⁻²ᵏ, 11/13 = e⁻², ln(11/13) = -2k, k = (ln13 - ln11)/2

Then,the model is

T = 130e^((ln11 - ln13)/2)t + 70.

The coffee reaches 175°F when

175 = 130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t + 70, 105 = 130e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t, 21/26 = e^((ln11-ln13)/2)t, ln(21/26) = (ln11-ln13)/2t, ln21-ln26 = (ln11-ln13)/2t, t = 2(ln21-ln26)/(ln11-ln13)≈2.56

The coffee can be served about 2.5 minutes after it is poured. The coffee reaches 155°F at

155 = 130e^((ln11 - ln13)/2)t + 70, 85 = 130e^((ln11 - ln13)/2)t, 17/26 = e^((ln11 - ln13)/2)t, ln17 - ln26 = ((ln11 - ln13)/2)t, t = 2(ln17 - ln26)/(ln11 - ln13) ≈ 5.09

The coffee is too cold to be served about 5 minutes after it is poured

6.45Suppose the room is warmer 75°F) and, after 2 minutes, the coffee has cooled only to 185°F .Whent is the coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee be too cold to serve? Round answers to the neares half minute.

Just as systems exhibiting exponential growth have a constant doubling time, systems exhibiting exponential decay have a constant half-life. To calculate the half-life, we want to know when the quantity reaches half its original size. Therefore, we have

y₀/2 = y₀e⁻ᵏᵗ, 1/2 = e⁻ᵏᵗ, -ln2 = -kt, t = ln2/k

Note: This is the same expression we came up with for doubling time.

### Definition

If a quantity decays exponentially, the half-life is the amount of time it takes the quantity to be reduced by half. It is givenby

Half-life=ln2/k.

## Example 6.46

## Radiocarbon Dating

One of the most common applications of an exponential decay model is carbon dating. Carbon-14 decays (emits a radioactive particle) at a regular and consistent exponential rate. Therefore, if we know how much carbon was originally present in an object and how much carbon remains, we can determine the age of the object. The halflife of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years—meaning, after that many years, half the material has converted from the original carbon-14 to the new nonradioactive nitrogen-14. If we have 100g carbon-14 today, how much is left in 50 years? If an artifact that originally contained $100g$ of carbon now contains 10g of carbon,

how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years.

### Solution

We have

5730 = ln2/k; k = ln2/5730

So,the model says

y = 100e^(-(ln2/5730)t)

In 50 years, we have

y=100e^(-(ln2/5730)(50))≈99.40

Therefore, in 50 years, 99.40 g of carbon-14 remains

To determine the age of the artifact, we must solve

10=100e^(-(ln2/5730)t) 1/10=e^(-(ln2/5730)t) t≈19035.

The artifact is about 19,000 years old.

![](./images/fSf0vuaXzDDEAgAgyXRmAZQXXsG5HEIXZ.png)

6.46If we have $100g$ of carbon-14, how much is left after I years? If an artifact that originally contained $100g$ of carbon now contains $20g$ of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years

# 6.9 | Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions.

## Learning Objectives

6.9.1Apply the formulas for derivatives and integrals of the hyperbolic functions 6.9.2 Apply the formulas for the derivatives of the inverse hyperbolic functions and their associated integrals. 6.9.3 Describe the common applied conditions of a catenary curve.

We were introduced to hyperbolic functions in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, along with some of their basic properties. In this section, we look at differentiation and integration formulas for the hyperbolic functions and their inverses.

## Derivatives and Integrals of the Hyperbolic Functions.

Recall that the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are defined as

sinh x=(eˣ-e⁻ˣ)/2 and cosh x=(eˣ+e⁻ˣ)/2.

The other hyperbolic functions are then defined in terms of sinh x and cosh $x$ The graphs of the hyperbolic functions are shown in the following figure.

![](./images/fO8L0xg1zUKsnIExOErBGsIU2ItPVHuEG.png)

It is easy to develop differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions.For example, looking at sinh x we have

d/dx(sinh x) = d/dx((eˣ-e⁻ˣ)/2) = 1/2[d/dx(eˣ)-d/dx(e⁻ˣ)] = 1/2[eˣ+e⁻ˣ] = cosh x.

Similarly, (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x We summarize the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions in the following table.


$f(x)$|
d/dx f(x)
sinh x|cosh x
cosh x|sinh x
tanhx|$sech^{2}$ $X$
cothx|1.2 $-csch$ $X$

csch $X$|-cschxcothx

Table 6.2Derivatives of the

Hyperbolic Functions

Let's take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine functions match: (d/dx)sin x=cos x x = cOS x x = cos x and (d/dx)sinh x = cosh x The derivatives of the cosine functions,however, differ in sign: (d/dx)cos x=-sin x, but $(d/dx)$cosh x = sinh x As we continue our examination of the hyperbolic functions, we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions

These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral formulas
∫sinh u du = cosh u+C  ∫csch²u du = -coth u+C  ∫cosh u du = sinh u+C  ∫sech u tanh u du = -sech u+C  ∫sech²u du = tanh u+C  ∫csch u coth u du = -csch u+C

### Integrals Involving Hyperbolic Functions

Evaluate the following integrals:

### Solution

We can use $u$ -substitution in both cases.

a.Let $u=x^{2}$ .Then, $du= 2x$ $dx$ and
∫xcosh(x²)dx = ∫(1/2)cosh u du = (1/2)sinh u + C = (1/2)sinh(x²) + C

b.Let u=cosh x .Then, du=sinh x $dx$ and
∫tanh x dx=∫(sinh x)/(cosh x)dx=∫(1/u)du=ln|u|+C=ln|cosh x|+C.
Note that cosh $x>0$ for all $X$, so we can eliminate the absolute value signs and obtair
∫tanh x dx = ln(cosh x) + C

6.48Evaluate the following integrals

a. ∫sinh³x cosh x dx b. ∫sech²(3x)dx

## Calculus of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions.

Looking at the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that with appropriate range restrictions, they all have inverses Most of the necessary range restrictions can be discerned by close examination of the graphs. The domains and ranges of the inverse hyperbolic functions are summarized in the following table.


Function|Domain|Range

$cosh^{-1}$ $X$|[1,\infty)|[0, ∞)

![](./images/fQibUdBvGlS50BDVeop56wkd8tA6EO88r.png)
Fiqure 6.82Graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions

To find the derivatives of the inverse functions, we use implicit differentiation. We have

sinh⁻¹x, sinhy=x, (d/dx)sinhy = d/dx x, coshy(dy/dx)=1.

Recall that cosh²y - sinh²y = 1, socoshy=√(1+sinh²y) Then,

dy/dx = 1/cosh y = 1/√(1+sinh²y) = 1/√(1+x²)

We can derive differentiation formulas for the other inverse hvperbolic functions in a similar fashion.These differentiation formulas are summarized in the following table.

Table 6.4 Derivatives of the

 Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

Note that the derivatives of tanh⁻¹x and coth⁻¹x $x$ x are the same. Thus, when we integrate 1/(1-x²), we need to select the proper antiderivative based on the domain of the functions and the values of $x.$ Integration formulas involving the inverse hyperbolic functions are summarized as follows.

∫(1/√(1+u²))du = sinh⁻¹u+C, ∫(1/(u√(1-u²)))du = -sech⁻¹|u|+C, ∫(1/√(u²-1))du = cosh⁻¹u+C, ∫(1/(u√(1+u²)))du = -csch⁻¹|u|+C, ∫(1/(1-u²))du = {tanh⁻¹u+C if |u|<1; coth⁻¹u+C if |u|>1}

# Applications

One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform density is suspended between two supports without any load other than its own weight, the cable forms a curve called a catenary. High-voltage power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and strands of a spider's web all form catenaries. The following figure shows chains hanging from a row of posts.

![](./images/fEoNGFmUCclGqGGsuScHYEEcFm7U8GahP.png)
Figure 6.83 Chains between these posts take the shape of a catenary. (credit: modification of work by OKFoundryCompany,

Flickr)

Hyperbolic functions can be used to model catenaries. Specifically, functions of the form y=a cosh(x/a) are catenaries. Figure 6.84 shows the graph of $y=2$ y =2 y = 2cosh(x/2)

![](./images/fGh7MGzzSXGZx917kLCZVDow0eVi7Rd8Z.png)
Figure 6.84 A hyperbolic cosine function forms the shape of

a catenary.

## Example 6.51

Using a Catenary to Find the Length of a Cable

Assume a hanging cable has the shape 10cosh(x/10) for -15 ≤ x ≤ 15 ，where $X$ is measured in feet. Determine the length of the cable (in feet)

### Solution

Recall from Section 2.4 that the formula for arc length is

Arc Length = ∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²) dx

We have f(x) = 10cosh(x/10) ，SO f'(x)=sinh(x/10) . Then

Arc Length =∫ₐᵇ√(1+[f'(x)]²)dx =∫₋₁₅¹⁵√(1+sinh²(x/10))dx

Now recall that 1+sinh²x=cosh²x so we have

Arc Length = ∫₋₁₅¹⁵√(1+sinh²(x/10))dx = ∫₋₁₅¹⁵cosh(x/10)dx = 10sinh(x/10)|₋₁₅¹⁵ = 10[sinh(3/2) - sinh(-3/2)] = 20sinh(3/2) ≈ 42.586 ft.

√

6.51 Assume a hanging cable has the shape 15cosh(x/15) for -20 ≤ x ≤ 20 .Determine the length of the cable (in feet).

## KEY CONCEPTS

### 6.1 Areas between Curves

•Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve. they can also be used to find the area between two curves.

·To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions

·If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of the region.

•Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to y to find the area. The principles are the same regardless of which variable is used as the variable of integration

## 6.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing

•Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by integrating the cross-sectional area

·For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The method of disks involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-sections are circles, and using the formula for the area of a circle

·If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of washers, the area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating

## 6.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

·The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite integral to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution. This method is sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of washers because we integrate with respect to the other variable. In some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than the

other.

·The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are the main factors in deciding which integratior method to use

### 6.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

•The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral ·The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum. Taking a limit then gives us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of $y$ ·The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution ·The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult to evaluate. It may be necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.

## 6.5 Physical Applications

•Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics. ·Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known. ·Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of gravity, as in a pumping problem ·Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid

## 6.6 Moments and Centers of Mass

·Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of mass can be thought of as the balancing point of the system. ·For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is M = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ mᵢxᵢ For point asdistibue in lane the mens f thesyse withrespecto the χ- anc yaes, esecisly are Mₓ=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢyᵢ and Mᵧ=∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿmᵢxᵢ resectively ·For a lamina bounded above by a function $f(x)$ ，the moments of the system with respect to the χ- and $y$ -axes, respetively are Mₓ = ρ∫ₐᵇ [f(x)]²/2 dx and Mᵧ=ρ∫ₐᵇxf(x)dx ·The $X-$ and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around the y-axis and around the $X$ -axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says that if a region is symmetric with respect to a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line ·The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region

## 6.7 Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms.

•The earlier treatment of logarithms and exponential functions did not define the functions precisely and formally This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way •The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral ·The function e^λ is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm ·General exponential functions are defined in terms of $e^{x}$ .and the corresponding inverse functions are general logarithms,

•Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context

## 6.8 Exponential Growth and Decay

·Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions ·Systems that exhibit exponential growth follow a model of the form y = y₀eᵏⁱ ·In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words, 
y'=ky •Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by (ln2)/k · Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form y=y₀e⁻ᵏᵐ •Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by (ln2)/k

## 6.9 Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions

•Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiation formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses Implicit differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the inverse hyperbolic functions, which in turn give rise to integration formulas The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries

This equation assumes that if there is more prey, the predator is able to increase consumption linearly. This assumption is unphysical because we would expect there to be some saturation point at which there is too much prey for the predator to consume adequately 173. a.

the amount of prey is extremely small,the rate at which predator growth is increasing is increasing, but when the amount of prey reaches above a certain threshold, the rate at which predator growth is increasing begins to decrease. d. At lower levels of prey the prey is more easily able to avoid detection by the predator, so fewer prey individuals are consumed, resulting in less predaton growth.

53. If $[c,d]$ is a subinterval of $[a,b]$ under one of the left-endpoint sum rectangles, then the area of the rectangle contributing to the left-endpoint estimate is $f(c)(d-c)$ .But, f(c)≤f(x) for c ≤ x ≤ d ,so the area under the graph of $f$ between C and $d$ is $f(c)(d-c)$ plus the area below the graph of $f$ but above the horizontal line segment at height $f(c)$ , which is positive. As this is true for each left-endpoint sum interval, it follows that the left Riemann sum is less than or equal to the area below the graph of $f$ on $[a,b]$
